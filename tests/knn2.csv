66,Mike Roberts & Brian Roberts,1-Dec-08,"""You Can't Steal Second Base and Keep Your Foot on First"" is the title of my book (written with my son Brian, 2nd Baseman for the Baltimore Orioles) and we also have a new teaching DVD about Base Stealing which shows many of the techniques developed by Brian during his career. Brian was small and a very average amateur player until he was 19 years old. Base stealing kept him enjoying baseball, gave him some confidence, and helped him help his team until he became stronger and improved his other skills.
Brian grew up playing in the backyard with his parents and friends. He played the game of Pickle most days, which helped his base stealing instincts. ""Backyard Baseball is a Passionate, Instinctive, Fun Game"" and I post these words in the home dugout of the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape Cod League.
Base Stealing will bring consistency to a baseball offense regardless of team speed. I have 25 new players in Cotuit, Ma. each summer. We begin base stealing practice the first day and work on this aspect of the game almost every day. The Kettleers have won the Cape Cod League Championship 2 of the past 4 seasons including August 2013. Base stealing is the key element that brings that consistency and keeps constant pressure on the opposing team.
Definition of Base Stealing: A runner(s) trying to take advantage of the defensive team thru good technique and speed going in a straight line to advance a base as the ball is thrown from the pitcher to the catcher.
Confidence: The base stealer(s) must feel they have control of the game even though the pitcher is initially in control of the baseball.
Comfort: The base stealer must be as comfortable when off the base preparing to steal as they are when just standing on the base.",0,14.99,MRob Publishing,You Can't Steal Second Base and Keep Your Foot on First!,left

Initially scoffed at because he continued approaching 100 mph on the radar gun, everything changed when Richard collapsed while playing catch with a teammatelater diagnosed as a life-threatening stroke. The shocking development ended Richard's major league career and set off a chain of events that led to the former All-Star being homeless by the mid-1990s. This rapid rise and sudden, tragic fall define the unusual, moving, and inspirational life of a Houston icon who has endured many hardships but has become an admired figure in his adopted hometown.

As someone who retired from the game over eighty-five years ago, he is still the leader for career batting average, second in runs, hits, and triples, and a mainstay in dozens of other categories.However, when most people think of The Georgia Peach, theyre reminded of his reputation as a dirty player.

He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrificeand pioneering surgeryhe recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir.Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Woodens death at age ninety-nine.Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended. He eventually won an Emmy Award and other accolades for broadcasting and was recognized as a leading media pundit.John Wooden once said that no greatness ever came without sacrifice.

819,Jonathan Kathrein and Others,1-Jul-12,"In Surviving the Shark, Jonathan Kathrein describes his incredible shark attack experience. The book covers all aspects of Kathreins survival, beginning with the eerie moments just before the attack, when something smashes into Kathreins hand as he paddles on his board, waiting for a wave off Stinson Beach in northern California. Realizing it is probably shark, and possibly a great white, Kathrein tries to paddle away, furiously trying to make it toward shore, where he sees some of his friends on the beach. But it is too late, as the great white returns, slams into him, then grabs his leg and pulls him underwater, thrashing him back and forth, trying to rip his leg off. How Kathrein is able to escape and make his way to shore, despite his horrific wounds, is nothing short of amazing. But thats just the beginning, as he now faces months of physical and mental rehabilitation, all the while dealing with the constant media attention that the attack has generated. Gradually, with the help of his family and friends, Kathrein makes a recovery. Today, Kathrein gives lectures on shark conservation, as well as on such topics as avoiding shark attacks when youre in the water. In this book, he not only writes of his ordeal, but also delves into shark behavior, and explains his desire to spread shark awareness. There is also an underlying theme of tremendous familial love and Kathreins extreme fervor for life.",224,16.99,Skyhorse Publishing,Surviving the Shark,left

Regarded as a legend by fans of both Hibernian and Liverpool, Peters playing career also included spells with Nottingham Forest and Bristol City before he moved into football management.  From the Cowshed to the Kop is a compelling account of a career spanning almost forty years. As soon as he joined Hibernian as a teenager, his quality shone through, and amongst his 99-goal tally was Hibs first in a glamour-friendly against a world-class Real Madrid side, which included Hungarian talisman Ferenc Pusks. He also starred in the famous Napoli game where Hibs beat the Italian giants 50 at Easter Road to overturn a seemingly impossible 41 deficit.   After a two-year spell in the English First Division with Nottingham Forest, Bill Shankly made his move and signed Cormack for Liverpool for a club record equaling fee of 110,000. He soon established himself as a key part of one of the greatest footballing sides of all time and won two League Championships, an FA Cup medal and two UEFA Cup medals before injury forced him out of the team. These were the glory days at the start of Liverpools dominance of domestic and European football, and Peter Cormack played his part in that incredible success story.

This is the first book to focus on the increasingly complex series of migratory processes that contour the contemporary game, drawing on multi-disciplinary approaches from sociology, history, geography and anthropology to explore migration in football in established, emerging and transitional contexts.
The book examines shifting migration patterns over time and across space, andanalyses the sociological dynamics that drive and influence those patterns. It presents in-depth case studies of migration in elite mens football, exploring the role of established leagues in Europe and South America as well as important emerging leagues on football's frontier in North America and Asia. The final section of the book analyses the movement of groups who have rarely been the focus of migration research before, including female professional players, elite youth players, amateur players and players families, drawing on important new research in Ghana, England, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Few other sports have such a global reach and therefore few other sports are such an important location for cross-cultural research and insightacross the social sciences.

Morris Keston was once just a regular football fan, but then he started befriending the Spurs players (sometimes by following them out of the ground and sitting next to them on the bus!). By the time the 1966 World Cup came around Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves were popping round for tea between training sessions, and when Spurs reached numerous cup finals in the seventies and eighties the players from both teams would flock to his wild after-match party instead of the clubs official dos. Beyond football he became friends with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Muhammad Ali.

In updating the late W. S. Kal's text, coauthor Clyde Soles focuses on the latest developments in technology and equipment. Readers learn, for example, that through digital mapping software, one can order the exact area desired, at any scale, and print it on waterproof paper.

Tilman, the solution lay in Africa  gold prospecting, mountaineering and a 3,000-mile solo bicycle ride across the continent. Tilman was perhaps the greatest explorer of his time, a famed mountaineer and pioneering sailor who made first ascents throughout the Himalaya, attempted Everest, and sailed into the Arctic Circle. For Tilman, the goal was always to discover new places, to explore rather than conquer. Snow on the Equator chronicles Tilmans early adventures; his transition from East African coffee planter to famed mountaineer. After World War I, he moved to Africa, meeting Eric Shipton and beginning a hugely successful mountaineering partnership. He hunted game, experimented with mining and climbed Mount Kenya, Kilimanjaro and Ruwenzori before embarking on a remarkable bicycle odyssey across Africa  recounted here in splendidly funny style. Tilman became one of the greatest of all travel writers. His writings are the works of a subtle and wry humourist with an ironic, yet cultured and committed world view.

3081,Mick Fowler & Chris Bonington,30-May-13,"On Thin Ice is Mick Fowlers second set of climbing memoirs, following Vertical Pleasure. Here, the celebrated mountaineer records his expeditions since 1990. Despite work and family commitments, he has maintained a regular series of big trips to challenging objectives around the world with a sequence of major successes: Taweche (1995, with Pat Littlejohn), Changabang (1997, with Steve Sustad, Andy Cave and Brendan Murphy), Arwa Tower (1999, with Sustad), Mount Kennedy (2000, with Cave), Siguniang (2002, with Paul Ramsden).  Siguniangs hard ice climbing on a fabulous face in deepest China was so admired by the international climbing community that it won the US Golden Piton and the French Piolet dOr, both awards given for the finest alpine achievements in the world during that year.  The author describes his travels in the great traditions, with engaging modesty and wit, but the climbs themselves are frequently so dramatic that the anxiety and tension forces its way to the surface to be matched by a corresponding relief and triumph when success and safe descent is achieved.  Mick Fowler has thus become Britains most successful exponent of high-standard lightweight mountaineering in the greater ranges. At 48 he is already something of an elder statesman of a cadre of international activists. They are steadily ticking off the most challenging lines in the world  a golden age of super-alpinism that is now in full swing.   How this influences activities on the 8000m peaks where the dangers (rarefied air, weather severity and sheer scale) are greater is an open question. History suggests that as major challenges on the lower peaks are steadily mastered the focus will return to technical challenges offered at the higher altitudes. Whether the results will exceed achievements such as the Kurtyka/Schauer (Gasherbrum 4) and the Bohigas/Lucas (Annapurna 1) remains to be seen.  The combination of exotic travel with major climbs provides the ultimate adrenalin-soaked holiday experience that Mick Fowler has mastered to the full. We are transported from the cliffs of Jordan, to remote peaks in deepest Asia, via Taweche and Changabang in the Himalaya, with jaunts to the Andes and Alaska thrown in for good measure. That Fowler has organised this routine for years, while holding down a conventional nine-to-five job with the Inland Revenue, has constantly amazed his peers. In this, his second book, he has also mastered the skills of amusing travel-writing to entertain us as a preliminary to the finale of a titanic struggle on each of his fiendishly demanding climbs.",300,13.99,Vertebrate Publishing,On Thin Ice,left
3097,Eric Shipton and Others,15-Oct-14,"When a man is conscious of the urge to explore, not all the arduous journeyings, the troubles that will beset him and the lack of material gains from his investigations will stop him. Nanda Devi is one of the most inaccessible mountains in the Himalaya. It is surrounded by a huge ring of peaks, among them some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalaya. For fifty years the finest mountaineers of the early twentieth century had repeatedly tried and failed to reach the foot of the mountain. Then, in 1934, Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman found a way in. Their 1934 expedition is regarded as the epitome of adventurous mountain exploration. With their three tough and enthusiastic Sherpa companions Angtharkay, Kusang and Pasang, they solved the problem of access to the Nanda Devi Sanctuary. They crossed difficult cols, made first ascents and explored remote, uninhabited valleys, all of which is recounted in Shiptons wonderfully vivid Nanda Devi  a true evocation of Shiptons enduring spirit of adventure and one of the most inspirational travel books ever written.",300,4.99,Vertebrate Publishing,Nanda Devi,left

In his decades as a renowned golf coach and player on the PGA and  Champions tours, Jim Hardy has attracted not only a clientele of  impressive players, but top teachers from around the globe flock to his  clinics as well.

3456,Alex Honnold,9-Nov-15,"The life and death-defying feats of Alex Honnold, a visionary climber of the sort that comes along only once in a generation.Only a few years ago, Alex Honnold was little known beyond a small circle of hardcore climbers. Today, at the age of thirty, he is probably the most famous adventure athlete in the world. In that short time, he has proven his expertise in many styles of climbing and has shattered speed records, pioneered routes, and won awards within each discipline. More spectacularly still, he has pushed the most extreme and dangerous form of climbing far beyond the limits of what anyone thought was possible.Free soloing, Honnolds specialty, is a type of climbing performed without a rope, a partner, or hardwaresuch as pitons, nuts, or camsfor aid or protection. The results of climbing this way are breathtaking, but the stakes are ultimate: if you fall, you die.In Alone on the Wall, Honnold recounts the seven most astonishing climbing achievements so far in his meteoric and still-evolving career. He narrates the drama of each climb, along with reflective passages that illuminate the inner workings of his highly perceptive and discerning mind. We share in the jitters and excitements he feels waking in his van (where he lives full time) before a climb; we see him self-criticize in his climbing journal (a veritable bible for students of the sport); and we learn his secrets to managing fearhis most enviable talent. Veteran climber and award-winning author David Roberts writes part of each chapter in his own voice, and he calls on other climbers and the sports storied past to put Alex's tremendous accomplishments in perspective.Whenever Honnold speaks in public, he is asked the same two questions: ""Aren't you afraid you're going to die?"" and ""Why do you do this?"" Alone on the Wall takes us around the world and through the highs and lows in the life of a climbing superstar to answer those fascinating questions. Honnold's extraordinary life, and his idiosyncratic worldview, have much to teach us about risk, reward, and the ability to maintain a singular focus, even in the face of extreme danger.",0,0.0,W. W.

Frustrated, he did not play again for six months; when he did he carded a 77. Determined to understand why he was able to shave nearly 40 strokes off his score, Kelley spent three decades of trial and error to unlock the answer and to recapture that one wonderful day when golf was easy and enjoyable. In 1969, Kelley self- published his findings in The Golfing Machine: The Computer Age Approach to Golfing Perfection.  The bestselling instruction books of the day required golfers to conform their swings to the author's ideals, but Homer Kelley configured swings to fit every golfer. He found an enthusiastic disciple in a Seattle teaching pro named Ben Doyle, who in turn found an eager student in 13-year-old prodigy Bobby Clampett. Clampett's initial success in amateur golf shined a bright spotlight on Homer Kelley and The Golfing Machine, but when the young star suffered a painfully public collapse and faltered as a pro, critics were quick to blast Kelley and his complex and controversial ideas.

Or the best tactical skills, both defensively and offensively? Not to mention measuring the strength of what a coach does behind the scenes, how he motivates his players, or how he keeps them from cracking under the pressure. Is the Hoodie the greatest coach ever, or just lucky to have Tom Brady? What about Bill Parcells, Vince Lombardi, and John Madden? Where do they rank?Such are the questions that pro football writer Steve Silverman addresses in Whos Better, Whos Best in Coaching?. As statistician Elliott Kalb did with baseball, basketball, and golf, and Silverman himself did with football players in Whos Better, Whos Best in Coaching?, Silverman takes the next logical step in this new book. Taking the analytical methods he developed over his years as a senior editor at Pro Football Weekly, he applies them to an evaluation of coaches going back to the earliest days of the NFL. The result is a fascinating ranking of the best of the sideline, from legendary old-timers like Vince Lombardi to present-day blue-collar coaches like Tom Coughlin. Throughout, Silverman discusses the many considerations that must be made when comparing modern coaches with coaches of past eras, or when comparing abrasive and domineering coaches with the more relaxed and Zen-like coaches.

His successes thinned out and he started to slide down the world rankings. Rory was making more headlines off the course and on the front pages of the tabloids after a legal dispute with his former management team Horizon; the constant press speculation as to whether he would represent Great Britain or Ireland in the Olympics; and his on-off relationship with Caroline Wozniacki, which led to a New Years Eve engagement in Australia and then the sudden shock split as wedding invitations were being prepared. Then, after all the traumas, came a double triumph in the summer in 2014 which Rory personally described as an unbelievable summer and the greatest golf of my life.

Instructed by NFL doctors that surgery wasn't an option, Lucas turned to painkillers for relief, but as his tolerance for medication escalated and his NFL insurance coverage expired, he began to plan his suicide. Just days before he planned to take his life, Lucas was put in touch with a group of doctors who agreed to perform neck surgery free of charge. In this tell-all, Lucas shares howin a league without guaranteed contracts and careers that average just a few seasons longplayers in the training room are perceived to lack the toughness necessary to succeed on the field.

Even in these high tech days of video analysis and Prozone (a system which tells how far each player has run in a game, how many passes and how successful they were etc.) football clubs could not operate without the human element of scouting. Les Padfield, though, is not your typical scout. Not many are published poets! A Londoner, he was a schoolboy footballer of great promise -- as he writes, Harry Redknapp, the Spurs manager, used to provide the crosses for him to score when they were schoolboys. He chose though to become a teacher of Physical Education, English and other subjects. He became a scout when, having been persuaded to attend a match at Millwall he meets an old friend, John Sainty, the chief scout at Preston North End. Sainty tells Les that the club's manager, David Moyes, is looking for a London-based scout. And even though Les moved on to Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League, the title 'Scouting for Moyes' was too good to resist. Les tells of the frustrations of the job, the perks -- a trip to Nigeria to watch a teenage prodigy who revealed he preferred to study medicine -- and the precarious nature of football life. Gary Megson, Bolton's manager who had also employed Les when he was in charge at West Bromwich Albion and Nottingham Forest, is sacked at the end of 2009. Les also offers the insight of a professional into the world,of football. Surprisingly his views are very often those of an outright fan.

Visitors to the United States need only watch a game or two to learn all they need to know about the American way of life and the beliefs, attitudes, and concerns of American society. Football and American Identity examines the social conditions and cultural implications found in the football subculture, represented by core values such as competition, conflict, diversity, power, economic success, fair play, liberty, and patriotism. This unique book goes beyond the standard fare on football strategy and history, or the biographies of famous players and coaches, to analyze the reasons why the game is the essence of the American spirit. Author Gerhard Falk, Professor of Sociology at the State University College of New York at Buffalo, examines football as a game, as a business, and as a reflection of the diversity in American life. Football and American Identity also addresses the relationship between football and the media, with much of the games income generated by advertising and endorsements, and examines the presence of crime in football culture. The book discusses the development of the gameand those involved in itat the Pop Warner, college, and professional levels, examining the social origin of players, coaches, cheerleaders, and owners. In addition, Football and American Identity analyzes the games fans and their devotion to their teams, examines why Pennsylvania is considered the mother of American football, and looks at the National Football League and its commissioners. Football and American Identity examines: how individualism and achievement can lead to mythological status  why a persons occupation is the most important indicator of prestige in the United States  what the consequences are of earning more in a year than most Americans make in a lifetime why equality is vital to the ethnic make-up of American football teams  why teamwork is important-in football and in industry how freedom is essential for taking the risks necessary for success  and much more!Football and American Identity is an inside look at football as an American cultural phenomenon.

In Perfect Rivals, award-winning sportswriter Jeff Carroll takes us inside the locker rooms and onto the gridiron, as two storied programs with very different cultures battle for national supremacy, school pride, and the soul of the game itself.Beginning with the Hurricanes nationally televised 587 pasting of the Irish at the Orange Bowl in November 1985, the two teams faced each other five times over a six-year span. The last three of those games had national championship implications, as a resurgent Notre Dame sought to reclaim its historic preeminence against a faster, mouthier, more talented Miami squad notorious for trash-talking opponents, stalking out of pregame buffets, and wearing military fatigues on the team plane. The games were marked by heartbreaking finishes, disputed plays, and nasty onfield brawls. Adding fuel to the fire was a controversial slogan created by a Notre Dame student and picked up by the pressCatholics vs. Convictswhich served to heighten the cultural (and, some would say, racial) tension between the opposing schools.Carrolls fast-paced, up-close-and-personal narrative centers on a handful of colorful characters on both sides of the rivalry: the coaches, from dapper Jimmy Johnson to punctilious Lou Holtz, and the players, including Miamis Steve Walsh, a quiet Midwesterner and one-time Holtz recruit who defied the freewheeling Miami stereotype, and devout Baptist Tony Rice, only the second black quarterback in Notre Dame history, who defined the rivalry and decided the contests.

He gives close attention to decisions by the NCAA in the early 1970s that helped transform student-athletes into athlete-students and turned the college game into a virtual farm league for professional football. The relentless necessity to pursue revenue, he argues, undermines attempts to maintain academic standards, and it fosters a football culture in which athletes are both excessively entitled and exploited./ In this compellingly argued and deeply personal book, respected sports historian Michael Oriard--who was himself a former second-team All-American at Notre Dame--explores a wide range of trends that have changed the face of big-time college football and transformed the role of the student-athlete. Oriard considers such issues as the politicization of football in the 1960s and the implications of the integration of college football. The heart of the book examines a handful of decisions by the NCAA in the early seventies--to make freshmen eligible to play, to lower admission standards, and, most critically, to replace four-year athletic scholarships with one-year renewable scholarships--that helped transform student-athletes into athlete-students and turned the college game into a virtual farm league for professional football. Oriard then traces the subsequent history of the sport as it has tried to grapple with the fundamental contradiction of college football as both extracurricular activity and multi-billion-dollar mass entertainment. The relentless necessity to pursue revenue, Oriard argues, undermines attempts to maintain academic standards, and it fosters a football culture in which athletes are both excessively entitled and exploited.As a former college football player, Oriard brings a unique perspective to his topic, and his sympathies are always with the players and for the game.

5357,Chicago Tribune Staff,28-Aug-12,"The Chicago Bears' 2011 season was over long before Major Wright's awkward landing on team captain Brian Urlacher's left knee, which ultimately required off-season surgery. Urlacher, writhing in pain on the Metrodome turf during the team's final game, was the final blow to the Bears' 2011 season, which had begun with a promising 7-3 record, ended with the insult of an 8-8 record, and serious injuries to the team's three biggest stars: Brian Urlacher, Jay Cutler, and Matt Forte. 2011's disappointing end marked the fourth time in the previous five seasons that the Bears failed to make the playoffs. While the most direct cause of the Bears' late-season slump was quarterback Jay Cutler's freak thumb injury in Week 11, a lack of depth, adaptability, and success in the draft meant the lion's share of the blame fell on general manager Jerry Angelo. He, along with controversial offensive coordinator Mike Martz, were dismissed at season's end and replaced by long-time scouting director Phil Emery and former offensive line coach Mike Tice, respectively. While Bears onlookers expected a big move during free agency, Emery surprised everyone by making one of his first acquisitions the all-pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Marshall, who played with Cutler for the Denver Broncos, instantly became the most talented receiver ever to grace a Bears roster. The reunion continued when another former Bronco, Jeremy Bates, was brought in to be the quarterbacks coach, completing the triumvirate that helped Cutler and Marshall put up some of their best statistical seasons in Denver. It seemed like the Bears were finally surrounding Cutler with the level of talent he would need to thrive in the pass-happy NFL.Despite added weapons on the offensive end, many questions persisted as the off-season continued. Would Matt Forte's tense contract negotiations be solved before training camp or would a lengthy, damaging holdout follow? Would unheralded first-round pick Shea McClellin help the Bears defensive line issues or would Emery's gamble echo the many draft busts of his predecessor? Would the offensive line protect Cutler enough for him to take advantage of his new weapons? Would Brian Urlacher return at peak form following his gruesome knee injury and mysterious surgery?

Although his team won the game, Johnny couldn't celebrate the win with his teammates. Johnny was too busy replaying his one error in the game, a missed grounder, over and over in his mind.

But no dinger has had greater impact than Hank Aaron's 715th home run. His historic blast on April 8, 1974, lifted him above Babe Ruth on the all-time list, an achievement that shook not only baseball but our nation itself. Aaron's magnificent feat provoked bigotry and shattered prejudice, inspired a generation, emboldened a flagging civil rights movement, and called forth the demons that haunted Aaron's every step and turned what should have been a joyous pursuit into a hellish nightmare.In this powerful recollection, Tom Stanton penetrates the myth of Aaron's chase and uncovers the compelling story behind the most consequential athletic achievement of the past fifty years. Three decades after Hank Aaron reached the pinnacle of the national pastime, and now as Barry Bonds makes history of his own, Stanton unfolds a tale rich with drama, poignancy, and suspense to bring to life the elusive spirit of an American hero.",288,10.99,HarperCollins e-books,Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America,left

6426,Michael J. Schell,3-Dec-13,"Tony Gwynn is the greatest hitter in the history of baseball. That's the conclusion of this engaging and provocative analysis of baseball's all-time best hitters. Michael Schell challenges the traditional list of all-time hitters, which places Ty Cobb first, Gwynn 16th, and includes just 8 players whose prime came after 1960. Schell argues that the raw batting averages used as the list's basis should be adjusted to take into account that hitters played in different eras, with different rules, and in different ballparks. He makes those adjustments and produces a new list of the best 100 hitters that will spark debate among baseball fans and statisticians everywhere.Schell combines the two qualifications essential for a book like this. He is a professional statistician--applying his skills to cancer research--and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of baseball. He has wondered how to rank hitters since he was a boy growing up as a passionate Cincinnati Reds fan. Over the years, he has analyzed the most important factors, including the relative difficulty of hitting in different ballparks, the length of hitters' careers, the talent pool that players are drawn from, and changes in the game that raised or lowered major-league batting averages (the introduction of the designated hitter and changes in the height and location of the pitcher's mound, for example). Schell's study finally levels the playing field, giving new credit to hitters who played in adverse conditions and downgrading others who faced fewer obstacles. His final ranking of players differs dramatically from the traditional list. Gwynn, for example, bumps Cobb to 2nd place, Rod Carew rises from 28th to 3rd, Babe Ruth drops from 9th to 16th, and Willie Mays comes from off the list to rank 13th. Schell's list also gives relatively more credit to modern players, containing 39 whose best days were after 1960.Using a fun, conversational style, the book presents a feast of stories and statistics about players, ballparks, and teams--all arranged so that calculations can be skipped by general readers but consulted by statisticians eager to follow Schell's methods or introduce their students to such basic concepts as mean, histogram, standard deviation, p-value, and regression.

3496,Doug Scott,,"At dusk on 24 September 1975, Doug Scott and Dougal Haston became the first Britons to reach the summit of Everest as lead climbers on Chris Bonington's epic expedition to the mountain's immense south-west face. As darkness fell, Scott and Haston scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags and, as it turned out, frostbite. For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-teller's prophecy given to his mother: that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching. Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front pages. Scott went on to become one of Britain's greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British climbing from the 1960s boom in outdoor adventure to the new wave of lightweight alpinism throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In Up and About, the first volume of his autobiography, Scott tells his story from his birth in Nottingham during the darkest days of war to the summit of the world. Surviving the unplanned bivouac without oxygen near the summit of Everest widened the range of what and how he would climb in the future. In fact, Scott established more climbs on the high mountains of the world after his ascent of Everest than before. Those climbs will be covered in the second volume of his life and times.

281,Evan Friss,,"Cycling has experienced a renaissance in the United States, as cities around the country promote the bicycle as an alternative means of transportation. In the process, debates about the nature of bicycleswhere they belong, how they should be ridden, how cities should or should not accommodate themhave played out in the media, on city streets, and in city halls. Very few people recognize, however, that these questions are more than a century old.The Cycling Cityis a sharp history of the bicycles rise and fall in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, American cities were home to more cyclists, more cycling infrastructure, more bicycle friendly legislation, and a richer cycling culture than anywhere else in the world. Evan Friss unearths the hidden history of the cycling city, demonstrating that diverse groups of cyclists managed to remap cities with new roads, paths, and laws, challenge social conventions, and even dream up a new urban ideal inspired by the bicycle. When cities were chaotic and filthy, bicycle advocates imagined an improved landscape in which pollution was negligible, transportation was silent and rapid, leisure spaces were democratic, and the divisions between city and country were blurred. Friss argues that when the utopian vision of a cycling city faded by the turn of the century, its death paved the way for todays car-centric citiesand ended the prospect of a true American cycling city ever being built.

1583,James C. Nicholson,,"An Irish immigrant, a collection agent for crime bosses, a professional boxer, and a prodigious gambler, John Morrissey was -- if nothing else -- an unlikely candidate to become one of the most important figures in the history of Thoroughbred racing. As a young man, he worked as a political heavy in New York before going to San Francisco in search of fortune at the height of the Gold Rush. After returning to the east coast, he was hired by Tammany Hall and was soon locked in a deadly rivalry with William Poole, better known as ""Bill the Butcher.""As time went on, Morrissey parlayed his youthful exploits into a remarkably successful career as a businessman and politician. After establishing a gambling house in Saratoga Springs, the hard-nosed entrepreneur organized the first Thoroughbred race meet at what would become Saratoga Race Course in 1863. Morrissey went on to be elected to two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the New York State Senate.In  The Notorious John Morrissey, James C. Nicholson explores the improbable life of the man who brought Thoroughbred racing back to prominence in the United States. Though few of his contemporaries did more to develop the commercialization of sports in America, Morrissey's colorful background has prevented him from getting the attention he deserves.

7170,"Edgar Prado, John Eisenberg",Apr-08,"A new superstar appeared on the American sports landscape in the spring of 2006: Barbaro, a three-year-old racehorse, won the Kentucky Derby by six and a half lengths, the largest margin of victory in sixty years. Barbaro's impressive performance immediately stirred talk of a possible Triple Crown. But in the opening yards of the Preakness Stakes two weeks later, the horse suffered a catastrophic leg injury that ended his undefeated career and left him fighting for his life. Edgar Prado, a native of Peru and one of the world's top jockeys, rode Barbaro to glory and then stood beside him for months as the horse valiantly struggled to survive and millions of fans held their breath. Having ridden in more than twenty-five thousand races over the previous two decades, Prado thought he had been around too long to fall for any one horse, but Barbarointelligent, charismatic, and resourceful in sickness as well as in healthstole his heart.In My Guy Barbaro, Prado recounts his own story, a tale of grit and dreams that moves from his impoverished childhood in Lima, Peru, to the winner's circles of the greatest racetracks in the world, and memorably chronicles his emotional time with Barbaro before, during, and after the horse's breakdown. Their bond was special and immeasurable. With Prado still reeling from a wrenching personal loss, Barbaro lifted his spirits by giving him the ride of a lifetime in the Derby. When the tables turned and the horse needed support two weeks later, Prado was there, going out of his way to make a succession of visits to the New Bolton Center, the animal hospital in Pennsylvania where Barbaro underwent more than two dozen surgeries and was ultimately put down. Barbaro made worldwide headlines for eight months, and now Prado's poignant, clear-eyed narrative takes us where no reader has gone beforeonto Barbaro's back in the heat of a race and into the intensive care suite where Barbaro's life-and-death drama played itself out. My Guy Barbaro is a heartwarming, unforgettable story of a man and his love for a beautiful animal and an irreplaceable teammate.

Following his last game as Cubs announcer, long after all the players had left the field, nearly everyone left in the stadium looked up to the broadcast booth and chanted Stoney! Stoney! for several minutes. In Said in Stone, the Cy Young award-winning pitcher and perhaps future Hall of Fame broadcaster offers his unique slant on the game that has been his passion for nearly five decades. He starts by analyzing the game position by position, illustrating his points with personal experiences and players he's played with and covered. What he hasn't seen, his broadcast partner of 15 years, Harry Caray, probably had, and he shares plenty of funny stories about their years together in the booth as well. Finally he takes a serious look at how the game has changed and what the future holds for America's pastime.

11109,Shawn Fury,,"Its hard to believe that there was a time when the jump shot didnt exist in basketball. When the sport was invented in 1891, players would take set shots with both feet firmly planted on the ground. Defenders controlled the sport, the pace was slower, and games would frequently end with scores fit for a football field. It took almost forty years before players began shooting jump shots of any kind and sixty-five years before it became a common sight. When the first jump shooting pioneers left the ground, they rose not only above their defenders, but also above the sports conventions. The jump shot created a soaring offense, infectious excitement, loyal fans, and legends. Basketball would never be the same.Rise and Fire celebrates this crucial shot while tracing the history of how it revolutionized the game, shedding light on all corners of the basketball world, from NBA arenas to the playgrounds of New York City and the barns of Indiana. Award-winning journalist Shawn Fury obsesses over the jump shot, explores its fundamentals, puzzles over its complexities, marvels at its simplicity, and honors those who created some of basketballs greatest moments. Part history, part travelogue, and part memoir, Rise and Fire bounces from the dirt courts of the 1930s to todays NBA courts and state-of-the-art shooting labs, examining everything from how nets and rims affect a shooter to rivalries between shooting coaches to how the three-pointer came to rule the game. Impeccably researched and engaging, the book features interviews and profiles of legendary figures like Jerry West, Bob McAdoo, Ray Allen, and Denise Long---the first woman ever drafted by the NBA, plus dozens more, revealing the evolution of the shot over time.Analyzing the techniques and reliving some of the most unforgettable plays from the greats, Fury creates a technical, personal, historical, and even spiritual examination of the shot. This is not a dry how-to textbook of basketball mechanics; it is a lively tour of basketball history and a love letter to the sport and the shot that changed it forever.

Duke's new man was Mike Krzyzewski. The only problem was, no one knew who Krzyzewski was, he had a so-so record in his short time as head coach of Army, and worst of all, no one could even pronounce his name. The announcement caused head scratches . . . if not immediate calls for his head . . . and on this note his career at Duke began.  The table was set nine days later, when on March 27, 1980, Jim Valvano was hired by North Carolina State to be their new head coach. The hiring didn't raise as many eyebrows, but with the exuberant Valvano on board, two new coaches were now in place to challenge Dean Smithand the most sensational competitive decade in history was about to unfold.
