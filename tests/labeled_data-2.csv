Base stealing kept him enjoying baseball, gave him some confidence, and helped him help his team until he became stronger and improved his other skills.
Brian grew up playing in the backyard with his parents and friends. He played the game of Pickle most days, which helped his base stealing instincts.

Definition of Base Stealing: A runner(s) trying to take advantage of the defensive team thru good technique and speed going in a straight line to advance a base as the ball is thrown from the pitcher to the catcher.

As darkness fell, Scott and Haston scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags and, as it turned out, frostbite. For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-teller's prophecy given to his mother: that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching. Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front pages. Scott went on to become one of Britain's greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British climbing from the 1960s boom in outdoor adventure to the new wave of lightweight alpinism throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In Up and About, the first volume of his autobiography, Scott tells his story from his birth in Nottingham during the darkest days of war to the summit of the world. Surviving the unplanned bivouac without oxygen near the summit of Everest widened the range of what and how he would climb in the future. In fact, Scott established more climbs on the high mountains of the world after his ascent of Everest than before. Those climbs will be covered in the second volume of his life and times.

Working once again with New York Times best-selling collaborator Daniel Paisner, who teamed with the former All-Star pitcher on his acclaimed 2009 memoir Game 7, 1986, Darling offers a book for the thinking baseball fan, a chance to reflect on what it means to compete at the game's highest level, with everything on the line.

Five years later, the resurrected varsity baseball program was in the final game of the College World Series, fulfilling the seemingly impossible promise made by Gene Stephenson when he began recruiting players to a place that didnt even have a practice field. Stephenson would lead the Shockers for over three decades, but those first five years with the team set him on the course that put him among the winningest coaches in college baseball history.",144,9.99,The History Press,Wichita State Baseball Comes Back,John B Lord,Feb-14,"Bill Giles oversaw one of the greatest eras of winning that the Philadelphia Phillies ever enjoyed. In Bill Giles and Baseball, John Lord chronicles Giles' remarkable career--which includes 44 years with the Phillies--to provide an insider's view of the business of the sport, which takes place off the field.

Based on extensive interviews, Bill Giles and Baseball spans Giles' life from his childhood growing up in the game to the tumultuous years he spent as the president and managing partner of the Phillies. Purchasing the team in 1981, when baseball experienced its first serious labor stoppages, Giles also watched baseball add franchises, grapple with franchise fees, realign the leagues, and restructure baseball's postseason. Yet Giles, the public face of the Phillies championship teams of 1980, 1983, and 1993, is best remembered for his critical role in creating innovative TV deals, and leading the efforts to build the Phillies' beautiful new ballpark.

A book about the business of baseball as seen through the eyes of one of the architects of the game, Bill Giles and Baseball captures the spectacle of the sport through fascinating behind-the-scenes stories of our national pastime.

Instances come from scandals within the established churches, as well as cases from the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Tour de France, and the inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster in the UK. It considers the importance of the context within which moral conduct takes place and the relevance of this for the occurrence of hypocritical action, while exploring also the implications of advances in computer and information technology for controlling messages and monitoring deceit.Identifying the negative effects of the detection of hypocrisy at individual and institutional levels, the author engages with the work of Goffman to argue for the importance of trust in institutions, underlining the necessity of minimizing and correcting hypocritical acts by which this is undermined. A detailed study of hypocrisy and the need for trust, this volume will appeal to scholars and students of sociology with interests in social and moral conduct, sport, religion, Goffman and the notion of social life as artifice.

In the process, debates about the nature of bicycleswhere they belong, how they should be ridden, how cities should or should not accommodate themhave played out in the media, on city streets, and in city halls. Very few people recognize, however, that these questions are more than a century old.The Cycling Cityis a sharp history of the bicycles rise and fall in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, American cities were home to more cyclists, more cycling infrastructure, more bicycle friendly legislation, and a richer cycling culture than anywhere else in the world. Evan Friss unearths the hidden history of the cycling city, demonstrating that diverse groups of cyclists managed to remap cities with new roads, paths, and laws, challenge social conventions, and even dream up a new urban ideal inspired by the bicycle. When cities were chaotic and filthy, bicycle advocates imagined an improved landscape in which pollution was negligible, transportation was silent and rapid, leisure spaces were democratic, and the divisions between city and country were blurred. Friss argues that when the utopian vision of a cycling city faded by the turn of the century, its death paved the way for todays car-centric citiesand ended the prospect of a true American cycling city ever being built.

After all her preparation, after all the careful management of her team, and after their running so well for over a week, the huskies balked.

Nicholson,,"An Irish immigrant, a collection agent for crime bosses, a professional boxer, and a prodigious gambler, John Morrissey was -- if nothing else -- an unlikely candidate to become one of the most important figures in the history of Thoroughbred racing. As a young man, he worked as a political heavy in New York before going to San Francisco in search of fortune at the height of the Gold Rush. After returning to the east coast, he was hired by Tammany Hall and was soon locked in a deadly rivalry with William Poole, better known as ""Bill the Butcher.""As time went on, Morrissey parlayed his youthful exploits into a remarkably successful career as a businessman and politician. After establishing a gambling house in Saratoga Springs, the hard-nosed entrepreneur organized the first Thoroughbred race meet at what would become Saratoga Race Course in 1863. Morrissey went on to be elected to two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the New York State Senate.In  The Notorious John Morrissey, James C. Nicholson explores the improbable life of the man who brought Thoroughbred racing back to prominence in the United States. Though few of his contemporaries did more to develop the commercialization of sports in America, Morrissey's colorful background has prevented him from getting the attention he deserves. This entertaining and long-overdue biography finally does justice to his astounding rags-to-riches story while exploring an intriguing chapter in the history of horse racing.

1045,819,2288,Jonathan Kathrein and Others,1-Jul-12,"In Surviving the Shark, Jonathan Kathrein describes his incredible shark attack experience. The book covers all aspects of Kathreins survival, beginning with the eerie moments just before the attack, when something smashes into Kathreins hand as he paddles on his board, waiting for a wave off Stinson Beach in northern California. Realizing it is probably shark, and possibly a great white, Kathrein tries to paddle away, furiously trying to make it toward shore, where he sees some of his friends on the beach. But it is too late, as the great white returns, slams into him, then grabs his leg and pulls him underwater, thrashing him back and forth, trying to rip his leg off. How Kathrein is able to escape and make his way to shore, despite his horrific wounds, is nothing short of amazing. But thats just the beginning, as he now faces months of physical and mental rehabilitation, all the while dealing with the constant media attention that the attack has generated. Gradually, with the help of his family and friends, Kathrein makes a recovery. Today, Kathrein gives lectures on shark conservation, as well as on such topics as avoiding shark attacks when youre in the water. In this book, he not only writes of his ordeal, but also delves into shark behavior, and explains his desire to spread shark awareness. There is also an underlying theme of tremendous familial love and Kathreins extreme fervor for life.",224,16.99,Skyhorse Publishing,Surviving the Shark,Martina Sprague,Jul-12,"War is a human activity, not one that is limited by geographic location.

1110,906,7923,Jana Leifer,16-Jan-04,"Im Laufe der letzten Jahre hat sich im Bereich der Sportmotorik ein Negativtrend entwickelt, der bei weitem nicht nur von wissenschaftlicher Seite erfasst werden konnte. Zum Teil wurde dieser Trend von den Medien zwar stark publiziert, und ist deshalb wohl auch oft verschrft dargestellt wurden, trotzdem kann keinesfalls von der Hand gewiesen werden, dass vor allem der Sportunterricht in nchster Zeit vor einem nicht von der Hand zuweisenden Problem steht. Die Rede ist von der allgemein schwindenden krperlichen Leistungsfhigkeit der Kinder. Nicht zuletzt durch die neuen Medien, wie beispielsweise Computerkonsolen, wchst eine stndig grer werdende Isolierung und Abgrenzung von Jugendlichen, die anstatt mit ihren Freunden 'spielen zu gehen', ihre neuen Freunde 'spielen lassen'. Vor allem durch den daraus folgendem Mangel an Bewegung, terten heute bei Kindern vermehrt Fettleibigkeit, Haltungsstrungen und daraus folgende koordinative Schwierigkeiten auf. Der Sportunterricht beinhaltet nun Kompetenzen, die unter anderem diesen motorischen Schwchen entgegenwirken sollen. Doch bevor man gezielt auf entsprechende Mngel oder Strungen einwirken kann, muss vorab die Mglichkeit fr eine Diagnose geschaffen werden. Dies erfolgt ber alternative Testablufe. Und genau an diesem Punkt setzt das Thema dieser Arbeit an. Nachfolgend soll geklrt werden, in welchen Bereichen diese Tests angewandt werden, in welchen Formen dies mglich ist und welche Aussagekraft diese zur Leistungsdiagnose angewandte Methoden besitzen. Dazu ist auf eine umfassende Begriffsklrung der Hauptgegenstnde nicht zu verzichten. Im praktischen Teil dieser Arbeit soll eines dieser Testsysteme genauer vorgestellt werden, welches auch im Rahmen dieser Arbeit seine Anwendung fand - der Krperkoordinationstest (KTK). Abschlieend erfolgt eine Auswertung des Testverfahrens und eine persnliche Stellungnahme zum allgemeinen Thema der Testsysteme im Punkt 'Fazit'.",71,37.99,GRIN Verlag,Sportmotorische Tests im Unterricht der Grundschule,Jana Kutschfreund,Jan-14,"Viele Sportler entscheiden sich im Laufe ihres Werdeganges dazu, ihren Sport zum Beruf zu machen und suchen dementsprechend nach den bestmglichen Optionen, um ihre Karriere voranzutreiben. Die internationalen Beziehungen im Sport tragen immens dazu bei, dass ein Athlet zwischen verschiedenen Angeboten whlen kann. Als Resultat besitzt der die Mglichkeit seine Karriere an einem fremden Ort bei besseren Trainingsmglichkeiten und besseren finanziellen Verhltnissen fortzufhren. Nicht selten kann es dabei vorkommen, dass auch auslndische Vereine als Karriereoption gelten, sodass sich die oben genannten unterschiedlichen Herknfte in vielen Kadern erklren lassen. In diesem Zusammenhang stellt sich jedoch die Frage, wie solche Migrationsprozesse von Spitzensportlern generell beschrieben werden knnen. Weiterhin interessiert, ob primr finanzielle Aspekte einen Wohnortswechsel im Sinne der Karriere entscheiden oder gar andere ausschlaggebende Faktoren wichtig fr die Entscheidung sind. Ebenso ist fraglich, wie lange solche Sportler an einem jeweils neuen Standort verweilen, ob sie einen langfristigen Aufenthalt planen oder eines Tages definitiv an ihren Herkunftsort zurckkehren mchten. Das Wanderverhalten von Leistungssportlern stellt hinsichtlich solcher Fragen ein sehr komplexes Themengebiet dar. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Migrationsprozesse von Athleten im Spitzensport besser nachvollziehen und erklren zu knnen.Auszug aus dem TextTextprobe:Kapitel 2.4, Entscheidungsgrundlagen fr Migrationsprozesse:Nachdem im Vorfeld grundlegende Begrifflichkeiten, Formen wie auch Typologien der Migration vorgestellt wurden, sollen in diesem Kapitel Entscheidungsgrundlagen fr eine Migrationsentscheidung im Vordergrund stehen. Wie herausgestellt, sind die Beweggrnde fr Migrationsprozesse vielfltig und individueller Natur. In der Literatur lassen sich unterschiedliche Anstze finden, die auf den Prozess der Entscheidungsfindung eingehen. Im Folgenden sollen drei Grundlagen thematisiert werden, welche fr die Migrationsprozesse von Athleten im Spitzensport reprsentativ wirken.2.4.1, Push- und Pull-Faktoren:Um die Push- und Pull-Faktoren bezogen auf Migrationsprozesse zu beschreiben, dient die deutsche bersetzung der englisch-stmmigen Verben zu einem ersten Verstndnis. Das Verb push lsst sich mit dem deutschen drcken gleichsetzen (vgl. Willmann, Trck, Messinger, 2002, S.484), wobei pull mit ziehen bersetzt werden kann (vgl. Willmann et al., 2002, S.481). bertrgt man diese grundlegenden bersetzungen auf einen Migrationsprozess, werden einerseits solche Faktoren beschrieben, die innerhalb des Herkunftslandes einen Wohnortswechsel in gewisser Weise forcieren. Andererseits existieren Faktoren, die das Ankunftsland bietet und somit attraktiv oder anziehend fr das Migrationssubjekt wirken lsst.Geis (2005) versucht in einer Gegenberstellung die grundlegenden Faktoren des Push- und Pull-Konzeptes verallgemeinert darzulegen. Demnach verluft ein Vergleich beider Lnder wie folgt fr das Migrationssubjekt ab: Whrend die aktuelle Situation im Aufenthaltsland zunchst als unattraktiv bewertet wird, erscheinen bestimmte Perspektiven einer neuen Region umso anziehender fr das Individuum. Daher beziehen sich die unattraktiven Faktoren innerhalb des Landes zunchst auf die Gegenwart, wobei die Pull-Faktoren des Ziellandes immer auf die Zukunft verweisen. Es lsst sich schlussfolgern, dass nach Geis (2005) die Push-Faktoren sinnlich betrachtet ein weg von der Gegenwart beschreiben, whrend die Pull-Faktoren dem fr ein hin zur Zukunft (S.29) stehen.Die hufigsten Push-Faktoren werden laut Geis (2005) durch Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut, politische Instabilitt, Kriege und Umweltzerstrung (S.28) reprsentiert. Dem gegenber stehen aus seiner Sicht Pull-Faktoren wie hhere Lhne, umfassende Sozialversicherungssysteme (S.28) und der Zustand politischer Stabilitt. Haug (2000) vertritt ergnzend den Standpunkt, dass Push- und Pull- Faktoren zu einer Verdeutlichung der Verflechtung zwischen Makro- und Mikroebene (S.15) dienen. Dies bedeutet folglich, dass sie die Beziehung zwischen den gesamtgesellschaftlichen Verhltnissen (Makroebene) und dem Individuum (Mikroebene) nher herausstellen. Um dies zu verdeutlichen, soll die Arbeitsmarktsituation innerhalb eines Landes als Beispiel angefhrt werden. So kann auf der einen Seite eine hohe Arbeitslosenquote als ein Push-Faktor fr den Migrationsprozess gelten, da er ein negatives Merkmal innerhalb des Aufenthaltslandes beschreibt. Auf der anderen Seite knnen im Vergleich hohe Beschftigungsquoten in einem anderen Land als Pull-Faktor betrachtet werden, da sie eine Wanderung mit dem Ziel einer Beschftigung im jeweiligen Land, deutlich attraktiver erscheinen lassen. Die beruflichen Gegebenheiten in beiden Lndern polarisieren in diesem Fall, sodass ein Migrationsprozess durch die Druckfaktoren im einen Land, wie durch die Sogfaktoren im anderen Land, gleichermaen sinnvoll ist.Es lsst sich festhalten, dass ein individueller Vergleich bestimmter gesellschaftlicher Gegebenheiten im Aufenthaltsland mit denen anderer Lnder letztlich ausschlaggebend fr eine Migrationsentscheidung ist. Dabei ist anzunehmen, dass je grer die Polarisierung bestimmter Faktoren ist und je mehr gegenstzliche Faktoren generell vorhanden sind, die Entscheidung umso schneller fr einen Migrationsprozess erfolgt.

The 4 biggest weight loss myths and mistakes that keep people fat and stuck in a rut. If you've fallen victim to any of these (and most people have), you NEED to have this information. 


The 3 simple laws of healthy fat loss. All workable weight-loss methods rely on the three simple rules to achieve results, and once you know them, you don't need to chase fads.



Why long-distance jogging is an incredibly inefficient way to lose weight and what you should do instead to have a lean, sexy body that you're proud of. (The good news is it's easy and takes no more than 20 minutes per day!) 


A fat-incinerating method of cardio that you can literally do during the 2 - 3 minute commercial breaks of your favorite TV shows. 



4 killer circuit training workouts that not only me

As darkness fell, Scott and Haston scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags and, as it turned out, frostbite. For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-teller's prophecy given to his mother: that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching. Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front pages. Scott went on to become one of Britain's greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British climbing from the 1960s boom in outdoor adventure to the new wave of lightweight alpinism throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In Up and About, the first volume of his autobiography, Scott tells his story from his birth in Nottingham during the darkest days of war to the summit of the world. Surviving the unplanned bivouac without oxygen near the summit of Everest widened the range of what and how he would climb in the future. In fact, Scott established more climbs on the high mountains of the world after his ascent of Everest than before. Those climbs will be covered in the second volume of his life and times.

More than a century ago, George B. Thayer took his own first century, or one-hundred-mile bicycle ride. The Two-Wheeled World of George B. Thayer brings to life the experience of late nineteenth-century cycling through the heartfelt story of this important cycling pioneer.In 1886, just two years after his first century, Thayer rode his high wheeler across the United States, traveling from his home in Connecticut to California and back. Thayer took an indirect route without any intent to set speed records, but his trip was full of adventure nonetheless. Thayer loved going downhill, his legs over the handlebars, risking life and limb atop the large wheel on often rough and muddy roads. With aplomb and humor, he dealt with the countless other hazards he encountered, including dogs, mule teams, and wild hogs. Even bad weather and poor sleeping conditions could not keep Thayer down.After his epic tour across the United States, Thayer had the urge to cycle abroad and eventually toured England, Germany, Belgium, and Canada on his bike. His later travels were in part aided by his hometown of Hartford, Connecticut, which was the epicenter of American bicycle manufacturing in the late 1890s. In addition to telling Thayers cycling story, Kevin J. Hayes brings to life the culture of cycling and its rise at the end of the nineteenth century, when bikes became more affordable and the nations riding craze took off.

They couldn't be more wrong.In this unprecedented new book, Alan Schwarz - whom bestselling Moneyball author Michael Lewis calls ""one of today's best baseball journalists"" - provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime's birth in 1845. He tells the history of this obsession through the lives of the people who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; Allan Roth, Branch Rickey's right-hand numbers man with the late-1940s Brooklyn Dodgers; Earnshaw Cook, a scientist and Manhattan Project veteran who retired to pursue inventing the perfect baseball statistic; John Dewan, a former Strat-O-Matic maven who built STATS Inc. into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse for statistics over the Internet; and dozens more.Almost every baseball fan for 150 years has been drawn to the game by its statistics, whether through newspaper box scores, the backs of Topps baseball cards, The Baseball Encyclopedia, or fantasy leagues. Today's most ardent stat scientists, known as ""sabermetricians,"" spend hundreds of hours coming up with new ways to capture the game in numbers, and engage in holy wars over which statistics are best. Some of these men - and women -- are even being hired by major league teams to bring an understanding of statistics to a sport that for so long shunned it.Taken together, Schwarz paints a history not just of baseball statistics, but of the soul of the sport itself.

From his early days with his hometown team Airdrie where he notched more than 100 goals for the club, to his time at Rangers and Hearts and his stint with West Ham, Sandy Clark has seen and done it all.  Now Sandy tells the inside story of his rollercoaster career. As a player, there was cup glory with Rangers, derby triumphs at Hearts, a host of controversial bust-ups with the likes of Ally McCoist and Willie Miller and the agony of being just seven minutes from winning the league title in 1986. And later, there was joy when Wallace Mercer gave him his big break as a manager at Hearts, and heartbreak when Mercer sold the club to Chris Robinson, who promptly sacked him. Then there was early success at St Johnstone, later overshadowed by a drugs scandal that rocked the club and Scottish football.  Now, as a coach and football pundit, he is respected throughout the game, and in From the Heart Sandy Clark lifts the lid on his controversial career and tells the whole remarkable story for the first time.",288,3.99,Black & White Publishing,From the Heart.

1631,1539,6376,Richard Elliott & John Harris,19-Sep-14,"Football is an incredibly powerful case study of globalization and an extremely useful lens through which to study and understand contemporary processes of international migration. This is the first book to focus on the increasingly complex series of migratory processes that contour the contemporary game, drawing on multi-disciplinary approaches from sociology, history, geography and anthropology to explore migration in football in established, emerging and transitional contexts.
The book examines shifting migration patterns over time and across space, andanalyses the sociological dynamics that drive and influence those patterns. It presents in-depth case studies of migration in elite mens football, exploring the role of established leagues in Europe and South America as well as important emerging leagues on football's frontier in North America and Asia. The final section of the book analyses the movement of groups who have rarely been the focus of migration research before, including female professional players, elite youth players, amateur players and players families, drawing on important new research in Ghana, England, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Few other sports have such a global reach and therefore few other sports are such an important location for cross-cultural research and insightacross the social sciences.

Friedman,Sep-08,"Whether enemy or ally, demon or god, the source of satisfaction or the root of all earthly troubles, the penis has forced humanity to wrestle with its enduring mysteries. Here, in an enlightening and entertaining cultural study, is a book that gives context to the central role of the penis in Western civilization. A man can hold his manhood in his hand, but who is really gripping whom? Is the penis the best in man -- or the beast? How is man supposed to use it? And when does that use become abuse? Of all the bodily organs, only the penis forces man to confront such contradictions: something insistent yet reluctant, a tool that creates but also destroys, a part of the body that often seems apart from the body. This is the conundrum that makes the penis both hero and villain in a drama that shapes every man -- and mankind along with it. In A Mind of Its Own, David M. Friedman shows that the penis is more than a body part. It is an idea, a conceptual but flesh-and-blood measuring stick of man's place in the world. That men have a penis is a scientific fact; how they think about it, feel about it, and use it is not. It is possible to identify the key moments in Western history when a new idea of the penis addressed the larger mystery of man's relationship with it and changed forever the way that organ was conceived of and put to use. A Mind of Its Own brilliantly distills this complex and largely unexamined story. Deified by the pagan cultures of the ancient world and demonized by the early Roman church, the organ was later secularized by pioneering anatomists such as Leonardo da Vinci. After being measured ""scientifically"" in an effort to subjugate some races while elevating others, the organ was psychoanalyzed by Sigmund Freud. As a result, the penis assumed a paradigmatic role in psychology -- whether the patient was equipped with the organ or envied those who were. Now, after being politicized by feminism and exploited in countless ways by pop culture, the penis has been medicalized. As no one has before him, Friedman shows how the arrival of erection industry products such as Viagra is more than a health or business story. It is the latest -- and perhaps final -- chapter in one of the longest sagas in human history: the story of man's relationship with his penis. A Mind of Its Own charts the vicissitudes of that relationship through its often amusing, occasionally alarming, and never boring course. With intellectual rigor and a healthy dose of wry humor, David M. Friedman serves up one of the most thought-provoking, significant, and readable cultural works in years.

It far outstripped the popularity of the three other football codes that are played in Australia  rugby league, rugby union and Australian Rules football. Yet the soccer participation phenomenon in Australia is matched neither by the media coverage of the game in these countries, nor by the academic interest in the game. With a few notable exceptions in academic sports history, the game of soccer remains understudied in comparison with the other football codes. And, apart from some interest that is generated by World Cup campaigns, the media coverage of soccer is largely marginalized, and becomes most emphasized when reporting on aspects of hooligan crowd behaviour.This book investigates some of the ways that soccer has been maintained as marginal to Australian identity, and why the sport remains vitally important to some marginalized groups within these communities.This book was previously published as a special issue of Sport in Society.

Nicholson,,"An Irish immigrant, a collection agent for crime bosses, a professional boxer, and a prodigious gambler, John Morrissey was -- if nothing else -- an unlikely candidate to become one of the most important figures in the history of Thoroughbred racing. As a young man, he worked as a political heavy in New York before going to San Francisco in search of fortune at the height of the Gold Rush. After returning to the east coast, he was hired by Tammany Hall and was soon locked in a deadly rivalry with William Poole, better known as ""Bill the Butcher.""As time went on, Morrissey parlayed his youthful exploits into a remarkably successful career as a businessman and politician. After establishing a gambling house in Saratoga Springs, the hard-nosed entrepreneur organized the first Thoroughbred race meet at what would become Saratoga Race Course in 1863. Morrissey went on to be elected to two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the New York State Senate.In  The Notorious John Morrissey, James C. Nicholson explores the improbable life of the man who brought Thoroughbred racing back to prominence in the United States. Though few of his contemporaries did more to develop the commercialization of sports in America, Morrissey's colorful background has prevented him from getting the attention he deserves. This entertaining and long-overdue biography finally does justice to his astounding rags-to-riches story while exploring an intriguing chapter in the history of horse racing.

2201,2220,6894,Cliff Green,14-Dec-11,"On Friday, 1 September 1989 Cliff Green boarded a plane from Heathrow to Nairobi to begin what he imagined to be a two year interlude to his teaching career in the UK. He was 27 and had never lived overseas before. In all respects he was very much a 'homeboy' being immensely attached to the British culture notably pop music, English pubs, Coronation Street and, most significantly, Everton Football Club. In all respects he was the last person on earth that anyone would have expected to live away from the shores of the UK. He even surprised himself with the decision. On 15 March 2011 he returned to England after more than two decades of teaching overseas in a journey that included Kenya, Bermuda and Uganda and a career path that led to his appointment in 2009 as Principal of one of the largest international schools in East Africa. There was also a personal journey of discovery and adventure loaded with humour and surprise and, while the pull of British culture diminished, the passion for Everton just grew and grew, no matter how difficult it may have been to 'get the result'.
Cliff Green was born in Andover, Hampshire on 27 September 1961. He developed a love for football from an early age and became besotted by Everton during the 1970 championship run-in idolising the Holy Trinity of Kendall, Harvey, Ball as well as his favourite centre-forward of all time, Joe Royle. Through the dire eighties of turgid football and an empty trophy cabinet, he clung onto the belief that Everton would once again become great. Determined to be a part of the revival, he left home to study for a degree in mathematical statistics at The University of Liverpool in 1980. After graduating in 1983, he worked as a trainee chartered accountant in Dale Street, Liverpool while watching Everton every week, including their most successful season in their history, and going to Rotterdam to see his team lift their only European trophy in 1985. The following year he left accountancy and studied for a PGCE at Bolton Institute of Higher Education while watching most of Everton's matches during their final championship winning season. After two years teaching at Shrewsbury Sixth Form College, he left England for a teaching career described in this book. On 21st December, 1996 he married a Ugandan lady called Violet.

2394,2303,8912,Alex Macdonald and Others,3-Oct-13,"Alex MacDonalds compelling memoirs cover his formative years as a player with St Johnstone, his rise to fame with Rangers, his transfer to Hearts where he became player-manager, and his time in charge at Airdrie. But Doddie is quintessentially a Rangers man, having grown up in Glasgow supporting them and then going on to play a key role in the clubs 1972 Cup Winners Cup triumph. Doddie won 12 medals in a glittering career, including a highly-prized European one during his time with Rangers, yet as he reveals, a chance meeting with Celtic manager Jock Stein might have resulted in him signing for the Old Firms other half. Etched indelibly in his memory, too, is the dejection he suffered when Hearts lost the League Championship and Scottish Cup within the space of a week in the mid-1980s and his subsequent delight at leading Airdrie into Europe. Doddie is a fascinating story, both for his lifelong love affair with football and his more personal story of growing up in Glasgow, his love of animals and his midlife crisis when he put the car in the garage and headed out on the highway on a brand new Harley Davidson. It has been a life full of adventures and characters and the highs and lows of his life and career are entertainingly and engagingly told.",256,1.99,Black & White Publishing,Doddie: My Autobiography. Alex MacDonald,Alex Ferguson,Jun-13,"Alex Ferguson, once king of Scottish football, gave up the easy life in Aberdeen to follow in the famous footsteps of Sir Matt Busby. Others had flickered and then faded in the shadow cast by the legendary Busby but Ferguson couldnt resist the call. Football is a strange obsession. Winning is a drug and when I got the invitation to manage Manchester United I simply could not resist, he says. For nearly six years he has chased the end of the rainbow and spent millions of pounds to bring the coveted championship to Old Trafford for the first time in 25 years. Now he feels it is time to tell the inside story of the best-supported club in Britain and his struggle to fulfil the title dream of thousands of supporters.        

He found the famous club in disarray and he admits he came close to the sack himself. No manager is prepared for the job at Old Trafford. The legend is huge. Its different from any other club with its traditions and expectations. It took me three or four years to understand the particular politics and demands. Only through success can a manager get control of his destiny.

Ferguson fought his battles and won the trophies which slowly but surely see him now established as a manager who has laid the old ghosts to rest and created a new vision. Winning the FA cup in 1990 bought him valuable time, and success in the European Cup-Winners Cup, beating Barcelona in a memorable final in Rotterdam, gave him the right platform for the most convincing championship challenge since the days of Busby.

After seven years at Aberdeen, Ferguson wrote A Light in the North, an account of how he broke the Glasgow stranglehold on Scottish football. Now comes the sequel of how he conquered English football at the helm of their greatest club.

And his nonangling friends and family may never again entirely recognize him, either. In other words, he (or she) will have entered Gierach territory. And fishermen who choose to brave the crowds at the big hold, commune with the buddies at the family pool, or even wade into questionable waters in the dark of night are sure to recognize themselves in Even Brook Trout Get the Blues.Whether debating bamboo versus graphite rods, describing the pleasure of fishing in pocket waters or during a spring snow in the mountains, or recounting a trip in pursuit of the fascinatingly ugly longnose gar, Gierach understands that fly-fishing is more than a sport. Its a way of life in which patience is (mostly) rewarded, the rhythms of the natural world are appreciated, and the search for the perfect rod or ideal stream is never ending. It is not a life without risks, for as Gierach warns: This perspective on things can change you irreparably. If it comes to you early enough in life, it can save you from ever becoming what they call normal. Even Brook Trout Get the Blues will convince you that normal is greatly overrated.",224,13.99,Simon & Schuster,Even Brook Trout Get The Blues,"Kirk Deeter, Charlie Meyers",May-10,"Two highly respected outdoor journalists, Kirk Deeter of Field & Stream and Charlie Meyers of the Denver Post, have cracked open their notebooks and shared straight-shot advice on the sport of fly fishing, based on a range of new and old experiencesfrom interviews with the late Lee Wulff to travels with maverick guides in Tierra del Fuego.

'I kicked off my shoes and prepared to climb in stocking feet, aware of an enormous sense of occasion as I laid hands on the rock and stepped up on the first rounded hold. It was not a hard climb but that was unimportant. I felt instinctively at home and at the finish experienced such a surge of happy elation that I knew then I was committed to climbing.' Martin Boysen's passion for crags and mountains springs from his deep love of nature and a strong sense of adventure. From his early days on rock as a Kent schoolboy after the war, he was soon among the most gifted climbers of his or any generation, famed for his silky technique. Boysen made a huge contribution to British rock climbing, especially in North Wales; he discovered Gogarth in the 1960s and climbed some of the best new routes of his era: Nexus on Dinas Mot, The Skull on Cyrn Las and the magisterial Capital Punishment on Ogwen's Suicide Wall. For more than two decades, Boysen was also one of Britain's leading mountaineers. A crucial member of Sir Chris Bonington's team that climbed the South Face of Annapurna in 1970, Boysen was also part of Bonington's second summit team on the South West face of Everest. In 1976 he made the first ascent of Trango Tower with Joe Brown. Along the way, Boysen climbed with some of the most important figures in the history of the sport, not just stars like Bonington and Brown, but those who make climbing so rich and intriguing, like Nea Morin and the brilliant but doomed Gary Hemming. He joined Hamish MacInnes hunting gold in Ecuador, doubled for Clint Eastwood on the North Face of the Eiger and worked on director Fred Zinnemann's last movie. Wry, laconic and self-deprecating, Martin Boysen's Hanging On is an insider's account of British climbing's golden age.

Yet she reached for the stars with hard work, perseverance, and her faith in God. Through the silence, she found the way to shine.Catch a Star tells Tamika's story of overcoming: of leading the Indiana Fever to its first championship, being named one of the WNBA's top fifteen players in history, earning three Olympic gold medals, and founding the Catch the Stars Foundation to help young people achieve their dreams.

In the autumn of 1982, a single stone fell from high on the south face of Annapurna and struck Alex MacIntyre on the head, killing him instantly and robbing the climbing world of one of its greatest talents. Although only twenty-eight years old, Alex was already one of the leading figures of British mountaineerings most successful era. His ascents included hard new routes on Himalayan giants like Dhaulagiri and Changabang and a glittering record of firsts in the Alps and Andes. Yet how Alex climbed was as important as what he climbed. He was a mountaineering prophet, sharing with a handful of contemporaries  including his climbing partner Voytek Kurtyka  the vision of a purer form of alpinism on the worlds highest peaks.

To understand why its so painful to give up the game, you must first understand the intimacy of the huddle. ""It ends for everybody,"" writes John Ed Bradley, ""and then it starts all over again, in ways you never anticipated. Marty Dufresne sits in his wheelchair listening to the Tiger fight song...Ramsey Darder endures prison by playing the games over in his head...Big Ed Stanton never took up the game of golf, and yet he rides the streets of Bayou Vista in a cart nearly identical to Coach Macs, recalling the one time the old man invited him for a ride.""

3281,3081,1970,Mick Fowler & Chris Bonington,30-May-13,"On Thin Ice is Mick Fowlers second set of climbing memoirs, following Vertical Pleasure. Here, the celebrated mountaineer records his expeditions since 1990. Despite work and family commitments, he has maintained a regular series of big trips to challenging objectives around the world with a sequence of major successes: Taweche (1995, with Pat Littlejohn), Changabang (1997, with Steve Sustad, Andy Cave and Brendan Murphy), Arwa Tower (1999, with Sustad), Mount Kennedy (2000, with Cave), Siguniang (2002, with Paul Ramsden).  Siguniangs hard ice climbing on a fabulous face in deepest China was so admired by the international climbing community that it won the US Golden Piton and the French Piolet dOr, both awards given for the finest alpine achievements in the world during that year.  The author describes his travels in the great traditions, with engaging modesty and wit, but the climbs themselves are frequently so dramatic that the anxiety and tension forces its way to the surface to be matched by a corresponding relief and triumph when success and safe descent is achieved.  Mick Fowler has thus become Britains most successful exponent of high-standard lightweight mountaineering in the greater ranges. At 48 he is already something of an elder statesman of a cadre of international activists. They are steadily ticking off the most challenging lines in the world  a golden age of super-alpinism that is now in full swing.   How this influences activities on the 8000m peaks where the dangers (rarefied air, weather severity and sheer scale) are greater is an open question. History suggests that as major challenges on the lower peaks are steadily mastered the focus will return to technical challenges offered at the higher altitudes. Whether the results will exceed achievements such as the Kurtyka/Schauer (Gasherbrum 4) and the Bohigas/Lucas (Annapurna 1) remains to be seen.  The combination of exotic travel with major climbs provides the ultimate adrenalin-soaked holiday experience that Mick Fowler has mastered to the full. We are transported from the cliffs of Jordan, to remote peaks in deepest Asia, via Taweche and Changabang in the Himalaya, with jaunts to the Andes and Alaska thrown in for good measure. That Fowler has organised this routine for years, while holding down a conventional nine-to-five job with the Inland Revenue, has constantly amazed his peers.

In one climbing year Peter Boardman visited three very different sacred mountains. He began in the New Year, on the South Face of the Carstensz Pyramid in New Guinea. This sharks fin of steep limestone walls and sweeping glaciers is the highest point between the Andes and the Himalaya, and one of the most inaccessible, rising above thick jungle inhabited by warring Stone Age tribes. During the spring Boardman was on more familiar, if hardly more reassuring, ground, making a four-man, oxygen-free attempt on the worlds third highest peak, Kangchenjunga. Hurricane-force winds beat back their first two bids on the unclimbed North Ridge, but they eventually stood within feet of the summit  leaving the final few yards untrodden in deference to the inhabiting deity. In October, he was back in the Himalaya and climbing the mountain most sacred to the Sherpas: the twin-summited Gauri Sankar. Renowned for its technical difficulty and spectacular profile, it is aptly dubbed the Eiger of the Himalaya and Boardmans first ascent of the South Summit took a committing and gruelling twenty-three days.

Their literary legacy lives on through the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature, established by family and friends in 1983 and presented annually to the author or co-authors of an original work which has made an outstanding contribution to mountain literature.

Mountains have had an outsized impact on American identity: the Rockies and Tetons pulled us westward toward Manifest Destiny; the Catskills and Appalachians stirred the transcendentalists; and Yosemite inspired the early environmental conservationists. Continental Divide tells this gripping history through four centuries of landmark climbs and thrilling first ascents.
With an incredible castincluding Lewis and Clark, Thoreau and Emerson, John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt, Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder, Tom Hornbein and Willi UnsoeldContinental Divide explores the rivalries that developed between daring, upstart climbers from the West, especially the Sierra Club, and their more traditional, upper-class eastern counterparts.

Washington to Denali, Maurice Isserman traces the evolving social, cultural, and political roles mountains played in shaping the country, and he describes how American mountaineers forged a brotherhood of the rope, modeled on Americas unique democratic self-image.",0,0,W.

Shortly thereafter, she left both her job and the United States itself to travel the world, and thus began her lifelong attraction to the exotic and remote sovereign state of Nepal. In the years that followed, she began reporting on the political and cultural events taking place in her adopted homeland for the likes of Reuters and Time Inc., letting the world in on the strange community of mountaineers, pilgrims and politicians who were descending on Kathmandu, whether in search of adventure, enlightenment or prestige.Despite the fact that Elizabeth Hawley has never climbed a mountain or visited the hallowed grounds of Everest base camp, she has become the most important record keeper and inspirational authority figure regarding the expeditions, stories, feats, scandals and disasters in the Nepal Himalaya. Now 90 years of age, she has commanded the respect of such legendary personalities as Edmund Hillary, Reinhold Messner, Chris Bonington, Toma Humar and Ed Viesturs.With production under way on a film examining her life and legacy, it is likely that Hawley will continue to hold a special place in the hearts and minds of all visitors looking to experience the legend and grandeur of the worlds most celebrated mountain landscape.",256,4.99,Rocky Mountain Books,Keeper of the Mountains,Alan Goldenbach,Oct-12,"""The Team, The Team, The Team"" has for decades been one of the University of Michigans best-known mantras. No one player, not even someone worthy of the Heisman, is considered greater than anyone else. With a history that starts with the likes of Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard, and Charles Woodson, it is no wonder the Wolverines are one of the most legendary forces in college football. But what happens when the uniform comes off and the pads get put away? Now fans of this legendary team will get the chance to catch up with the players they rooted for on the gridiron. University of Michigan: Where Have You Gone? offers a post-college look at over forty of the players who helped build the Wolverine legacy. Some had a singular moment that would forever define their careers. Others played an exceptional game, in many cases against the Wolverines biggest rivals. Still others are remembered for a marvelous season. All of them helped Michigan become, as the words to the schools fight song suggest, ""The leaders and best"" and ""the champions of the West.""

It is one of the most unrelenting and testing of the worlds 8000-metre peaks.  Jim Curran came to K2 as a climbing cameraman with an unsuccessful British expedition, but stayed on through the climbing season. This is his account of the dramatic events of that summer, a story of ambitions both achieved and thwarted on a mountain which all high-altitude climbers take the most pride in overcoming. In 1986 K2 took its toll of those ambitions.  Curran vividly describes the moments that contribute to the exhilaration of climbing on the world's most demanding mountain, and he assesses the tragedy of that summer with compassion and impartiality.",320,6.99,Hodder & Stoughton,K2: Triumph And Tragedy,Jim Curran,Apr-13,"K2 is the world's second highest mountain, but its savage reputation is second to none. The loss of Alison Hargreaves and six companions in 1995 was a grim echo of the multiple deaths in 1986 and of earlier disasters which have become part of climbing legend. K2 has always attracted the greatest names in mountaineering. Wiessner, Houston, Bonatti, Diemberger and Bonington are among those whose lives have been permanently scarred by their experiences on it. At the same time some inspiring new routes have been achieved on the world's most difficult 8000-metre peak.  Jim Curran, himself a survivor of 1986, has traced the history of the mountain from the nineteenth-century pioneer explorers down to the present, and sees a repeating pattern of naked ambition, rivalry, misjudgement and recrimination. He has also found selfless heroism and impressive route-making on the mountain that top climbers will always covet as the ultimate prize.

Well, Senator McCain is an authentic, living American hero.""  So begins Robert Timberg's gripping and penetrating biography of Senator John McCain, the man who may someday be President of the United States. In John McCain: An American Odyssey, Timberg provides a riveting account of McCain's remarkable life -- from his rambunctious childhood and his madcap escapades as a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman to his grim experiences as a combat pilot and POW in Vietnam, where he was held prisoner by the North Vietnamese for five and a half years. Most importantly, the author illuminates Senator McCain's postwar evolution into one of our country's most distinguished political leaders and a formidable presidential candidate. Inspired by the success of The Nightingale's Song (selected by The New York Times as a ""Notable Book of the Year"" in 1995 and by Time as one of that year's five best nonfiction books), John McCain: An American Odyssey probes more deeply into the life of this hugely colorful, straight-talking American original. It is a rich and captivating portrait of one of America's most fascinating and provocative public figures -- a man who has captured the imagination of millions of Americans and who will continue to be a most prominent figure on the American political landscape.

Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization, edited by Adam C. Earnheardt, Paul Haridakis, and Barbara Hugenberg, captures an eclectic collection of new studies from accomplished scholars in the fields such as communication, business, geography, kinesiology, media, and sports management and administration, using a wide range of methodologies including quantitative, qualitative, and critical analyses.In the communication revolution of the twenty-first century, the study of mediated sports is critical. As fans use all media at their disposal to consume sports and carry their sports-viewing experience online, they are seizing the initiative and asserting themselves into the mediated sports-dissemination process. They are occupying traditional roles of consumers/receivers of sports, but also as sharers and sports content creators. Fans are becoming pseudo sports journalists. They are interpreting mediated sports content for other fans. They are making their voice heard by sports organizations and athletes. Mediated sports, in essence, provide a context for studying and understanding where and how the communication revolution of the twenty-first century is being waged.With their collection of studies by scholars from North America and Europe, Earnheardt, Haridakis, and Hugenberg illuminate the symbiotic relationship among and between sports organizations, the media, and their audiences.

Examining the youth sports economy from many sides--the major corporations, small entrepreneurs, coaches, parents, and, of course, kids--Hyman probes the reasons for rapid changes in what gets bought and sold in this lucrative marketplace. Just participating in youth sports can be expensive. Among the costs are league fees, equipment, and perhaps private lessons with a professional coach. With nearly 50 million kids playing organized sports each year, it is easy to see how profitable this market can be. Hyman takes us to tournaments sponsored by Nike, Gatorade, and other big businesses, and he talks to parents who sacrifice their vacations and savings to get their (sometimes reluctant) junior stars to these far-off, expensive venues for a chance to shine. He introduces us to videos purporting to teach six-month-old babies to kick a ball, to professional athletes who will ""coach"" an eight-year-old for a hefty fee, to a town that has literally staked its future on preteen sports. With its extensive interviews and original reporting, The Most Expensive Game in Town explains the causes and effects of the commercialization of youth sports, changes that the author argues are distorting and diminishing family life. He closes with strong examples of individuals and communities bucking this destructive trend.

Barbaro's impressive performance immediately stirred talk of a possible Triple Crown. But in the opening yards of the Preakness Stakes two weeks later, the horse suffered a catastrophic leg injury that ended his undefeated career and left him fighting for his life. Edgar Prado, a native of Peru and one of the world's top jockeys, rode Barbaro to glory and then stood beside him for months as the horse valiantly struggled to survive and millions of fans held their breath. Having ridden in more than twenty-five thousand races over the previous two decades, Prado thought he had been around too long to fall for any one horse, but Barbarointelligent, charismatic, and resourceful in sickness as well as in healthstole his heart.In My Guy Barbaro, Prado recounts his own story, a tale of grit and dreams that moves from his impoverished childhood in Lima, Peru, to the winner's circles of the greatest racetracks in the world, and memorably chronicles his emotional time with Barbaro before, during, and after the horse's breakdown. Their bond was special and immeasurable. With Prado still reeling from a wrenching personal loss, Barbaro lifted his spirits by giving him the ride of a lifetime in the Derby. When the tables turned and the horse needed support two weeks later, Prado was there, going out of his way to make a succession of visits to the New Bolton Center, the animal hospital in Pennsylvania where Barbaro underwent more than two dozen surgeries and was ultimately put down. Barbaro made worldwide headlines for eight months, and now Prado's poignant, clear-eyed narrative takes us where no reader has gone beforeonto Barbaro's back in the heat of a race and into the intensive care suite where Barbaro's life-and-death drama played itself out.

What they want is golf, so the Nicols have devoted pages of attention to yardage and par, green fees, and special course features for hundreds of golf courses in the Caribbean, from Bermuda and the Bahamas to Jamaica and Puerto Rico. But there are other facets to consider as well, because the point here is to take a vacation, a golf vacation, where you get to luxuriate in your scenic vistas, eat your sumptuous meals, and play your 18 holes, too. There are resorts for all sorts, with rustic lodges or posh hotels; full-scale gourmet pampering or low-key environments; all-golf, all-the-time atmospheres; or resorts that offer the works--tennis, fishing, sailing, or skiing--for the spouses who just aren't as intent on golf, perhaps, as you. The important thing is that all types of golf holidays are possible, and the Nicols have done the legwork so all you have to do is browse, choose, and make the reservations.

4501,4269,8438,Michael Bartlett & Tony Roberts,4-Jan-11,"Golfers wanting to know the colourful stories behind names like Alcatraz, Biarritz, Cleopatra, Dell, Eden, Postage Stamp, and Redan can now turn to the only book ever devoted exclusively to the parthree hole. In Golfs Finest Par Threes Tony Roberts and Michael Bartlett have assembled what they call a an exemplary collection of the most spectacular, historic, challenging, and unusual oneshot holes on the planet.
The heart of the book is the authors list of the 100 greatest par threes in the world, chosen from thousands theyve seen during more than 30 years profiling and photographing golf courses. These are designated as gold and silver, and arranged by design and geographical categories such as links, island and peninsula, blind, drop shot, and more. Striking photography and factfilled profiles combine to reveal the distinct character of each hole.
Golfs Finest Par Threes also explains how the greatest course designers  notably, Macdonald, Colt, Tillinghast, MacKenzie, Ross, Thomas, Jones, Fazio, Nicklaus, Dye, and Doak  have created par threes. A closing section offers new perspectives on the oneshot hole: Best Sets and OutoftheBox threes, historic shots on par threes, and more.
Golfs Finest Par Threes is a beautifully packaged tour of golfs great short holes, one guaranteed to inform, entertain, and provoke vigorous debate about what makes a par three superior and memorable.",276,19.99,ECW Press,Golfs Finest Par Threes,"Tony Roberts, Michael Bartlett",Apr-11,"Alcatraz . . . Biarritz . . . Cleopatra . . . Dell . . . Eden . . . Himalayas . . . Postage Stamp . . . Redan. Ask someone to identify these names and they might respond: prison, city in France, Egyptian queen, secluded glen, paradise, mountain, mail fee, fortification. And they would be right. But for golfers, the correct answer is that each belongs on a list of the games best-known par-three holes. All owe their fame to a natural setting and the imaginative genius of gifted course designers who believed that less can really be more. At last count the United States Golf Association library contains 25,000 books, including 1,200 under the heading ""Golf Courses."" Search as one may, there is no volume devoted solely to the par-three hole. This was a curious omission that we decided to rectify. Our goal: Canvass the world for some of the finest, most interesting, dramatic, beautiful, historic, delightful and confounding one-shot holes and assemble them in a collection that showcases their particular virtues and role in golf history. Why else a book on par-three holes? Looked at imaginatively, a par three is ""the whole-in-one."" Most par threes let a golfer see the entire challenge  tee to green  and, with skill and luck, complete the hole in a single shot  the ace. In a distance-obsessed era, the threes remind us that controlled shotmaking is fundamental to the game, and, on many short holes, finesse is all. Augusta National Golf Club #12, Cypress Point Club #15 and Royal Troon Golf Club #8 exemplify this dimension. Maybe too its about respect. Golfs short holes are sometimes overshadowed by the tougher handicap holes that comprise the finishing stretches on a course. But look deeper, and gradually the list of threes that regularly produce high scores grows. They arent pushovers, for sure. And golf history highlights many a par-three seventeenth  the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, Pebble Beach Golf Links and Pinehurst Country Club No. 2 Course, for example  that has determined victory or defeat in major competitions. In his ""Thirteen Principles"" of golf course design, Dr. Alister MacKenzie, creator of Augusta National and Cypress Point, stated firmly that there should be ""at least four one-shot holes"" on every course. In his case, he also laid out two in a row (the fifteenth and sixteenth at Cypress Point), or made the eighteenth a three (Pasatiempo Golf Club). As we shall document, course architects know the importance of well-made, strategically placed one-shotters and use them to enhance the quality of a course. We very much subscribe to the thought of Japanese architect Shunsuke Kato who said, ""The importance of the par-three hole is that it truly represents the designers policy as to the character of the golf course. It is a wrong idea that a par-three hole is easy to make because it is just a short yardage. The [good] designer puts his heart into making a par-three hole special among others."" The top courses are distinguished by a strong complement of par threes, each good to great. In many cases, one of the threes becomes the signature hole. To set the stage for our collection, a Prologue presents the origin of three famous one-shot holes. This is followed by a brief essay, titled ""Evolution,"" which highlights the thoughts of leading designers about the par three and provides some historical context on its development. Course ratings and rankings seldom produce complete agreement. Our choices are based on many years of playing, walking and photographing courses worldwide. Buttressing our own judgment are the critical observations and writings of golf course historians and architects, leading golf writers from many eras and local experts who shared their takes on individual holes. For those who need to discriminate, we offer two tiers  ""Gold"" and ""Silver,"" and, for fun, weve created an ""Ultimate 18-Hole Par-Three Course."" Further, we think the arrangement of the top holes around a dominant geographical feature or distinguishing design element is a more interesting way to look at them. In the end, our selection of 100 from the 130,000 or so par threes in the world can only be illustrative of their overall excellence. We hope youll get to play some, or if you have already, to relive your experiences through our words and pictures.  Tony Roberts and Michael Bartlett

When the sport was invented in 1891, players would take set shots with both feet firmly planted on the ground. Defenders controlled the sport, the pace was slower, and games would frequently end with scores fit for a football field. It took almost forty years before players began shooting jump shots of any kind and sixty-five years before it became a common sight. When the first jump shooting pioneers left the ground, they rose not only above their defenders, but also above the sports conventions. The jump shot created a soaring offense, infectious excitement, loyal fans, and legends. Basketball would never be the same.Rise and Fire celebrates this crucial shot while tracing the history of how it revolutionized the game, shedding light on all corners of the basketball world, from NBA arenas to the playgrounds of New York City and the barns of Indiana. Award-winning journalist Shawn Fury obsesses over the jump shot, explores its fundamentals, puzzles over its complexities, marvels at its simplicity, and honors those who created some of basketballs greatest moments. Part history, part travelogue, and part memoir, Rise and Fire bounces from the dirt courts of the 1930s to todays NBA courts and state-of-the-art shooting labs, examining everything from how nets and rims affect a shooter to rivalries between shooting coaches to how the three-pointer came to rule the game. Impeccably researched and engaging, the book features interviews and profiles of legendary figures like Jerry West, Bob McAdoo, Ray Allen, and Denise Long---the first woman ever drafted by the NBA, plus dozens more, revealing the evolution of the shot over time.Analyzing the techniques and reliving some of the most unforgettable plays from the greats, Fury creates a technical, personal, historical, and even spiritual examination of the shot. This is not a dry how-to textbook of basketball mechanics; it is a lively tour of basketball history and a love letter to the sport and the shot that changed it forever.

On a global level he has strong views on professional rugby and the rise of the European game.This makes a fascinating contrast with Bennett's career as a player in the Seventies  the glory years of Welsh rugby  when the likes of Gareth Edwards, Gerald Davies and JPR Williams would dazzle the public with their breathtaking skills and scintillating tries. Bennett recalls how opportunism on the field was matched by bonhomie and revelry off it in the amateur days when pints took preference over practice.Bennett continues to be heavily involved in rugby through his work for BBC TV. And his influence on the game remains to this day.

It is also quite possible that it is the only rivalry to raise over $58 million in war bonds (1944 game), have an outcome so contentious that the game had to be suspended for six years by the President (1893), or be played in the Rose Bowl (1983), requiring a military ""airlift"" of nine thousand cadets and midshipmen to California.But Army-Navy is first and foremost about football, and as Barry Wilner and Ken Rappoport relate in this engaging history, it may be college football in its purest form-and not just as a ""training ground for the NFL."" Though struggling for national ranking, the service academies have done surprisingly well over the years given their recruiting handicap, producing five Heisman Trophy winners and a number of national champions. The rivalry's most successful player may have been Roger Staubach, Heisman winner and Hall of Fame quarterback, who led the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowls in the 1970s following his four-year mandatory service in the U.S. Navy. The Army-Navy rivalry is also about traditions, and in a concluding chapter on the 2004 game, the authors take us through the pageantry: the march into the stadium by the student bodies of both schools; freshman push-ups after each score; and the final, moving show of sportsmanship following the game as thousands of cadets and midshipmen stand at attention while the alma mater of each school is played by their respective bands.

Size matters. Thats why the SEC is Goliath, because the Southeastern Conference, top to bottom, has better coaches, better stadiums, better bank accounts, and better weather, but the real difference maker is the bigger and better players. For six straight years the SEC has walked off with the big crystal prize and will not give it back. The talk of big boy football grinds on the Buckeyes, Sooners, Longhorns, and Ducks. All they can come back with is Wait until next year. Then next year comes and the SEC tribe is chanting in the closing minutes of the National Championship Game, SEC, SEC, SEC! The national championship trophy has been in the South for so long it has sunburn. That is why college football is thick with the acrimony: SEC vs. Everyone Else. The dominance of the SEC has a lot more to do with the Souths culture than just the rock-em, sock-em of football played one day a week. The South lost the Civil War, and sociologists will tell you that there is still a regional angst, an us against them mentality, a spirit of those damn Yankees. It is not just about championships. The SEC is about culture and competitiveness. . . . It is about players. *** How the SEC Became Goliath provides an inside look at college footballs most dominant conference.

Size matters. Thats why the SEC is Goliath, because the Southeastern Conference, top to bottom, has better coaches, better stadiums, better bank accounts, and better weather, but the real difference maker is the bigger and better players. For six straight years the SEC has walked off with the big crystal prize and will not give it back. The talk of big boy football grinds on the Buckeyes, Sooners, Longhorns, and Ducks. All they can come back with is Wait until next year. Then next year comes and the SEC tribe is chanting in the closing minutes of the National Championship Game, SEC, SEC, SEC! The national championship trophy has been in the South for so long it has sunburn. That is why college football is thick with the acrimony: SEC vs. Everyone Else. The dominance of the SEC has a lot more to do with the Souths culture than just the rock-em, sock-em of football played one day a week. The South lost the Civil War, and sociologists will tell you that there is still a regional angst, an us against them mentality, a spirit of those damn Yankees. It is not just about championships. The SEC is about culture and competitiveness. . . . It is about players. *** How the SEC Became Goliath provides an inside look at college footballs most dominant conference. Four different schools in the SEC have won the last six championship titles: Florida vs. Ohio State in 2006 January 8, 2007  The Zook-Meyer Gators embarrass the Big Ten.

The tag is sure to stay with the Steelers for a long, long time. Fans in Pittsburgh can thank NFL free agency, but only in part.

The Steel Curtain was in decline, and the Houston Oilers were pounding on the door of the AFC. By the end of the season, of course, the banged-up Oilers were not to be feared, not with the San Diego Chargers gathering steam. In the NFC, the Dallas Cowboys could taste revenge, particularly after Steelers coach Chuck Noll had mocked them unmercifully following the previous years Super Bowl. However, the Steelers persevered. ""We probably won it more on desire, football intellect,"" said Steelers defensive superstar ""Mean"" Joe Greene. Greene admitted that the defense was in decline. He even admitted his great career was in decline, but he never thought the end of the dynasty was near. Star quarterback Terry Bradshaw, on the other hand, with his career just taking off, knew the end was at hand, and after his greatest season, after his second of back-to-back Super Bowl Most Valuable Player awards, Bradshaw hinted at retirement. ""I probably should have,"" he admits 25 years later. The 1979 season had exhausted Bradshaw, a topic he talks about in Tales from Behind the Steel Curtain. Greene also has plenty to say.

He gives close attention to decisions by the NCAA in the early 1970s that helped transform student-athletes into athlete-students and turned the college game into a virtual farm league for professional football. The relentless necessity to pursue revenue, he argues, undermines attempts to maintain academic standards, and it fosters a football culture in which athletes are both excessively entitled and exploited./ In this compellingly argued and deeply personal book, respected sports historian Michael Oriard--who was himself a former second-team All-American at Notre Dame--explores a wide range of trends that have changed the face of big-time college football and transformed the role of the student-athlete. Oriard considers such issues as the politicization of football in the 1960s and the implications of the integration of college football. The heart of the book examines a handful of decisions by the NCAA in the early seventies--to make freshmen eligible to play, to lower admission standards, and, most critically, to replace four-year athletic scholarships with one-year renewable scholarships--that helped transform student-athletes into athlete-students and turned the college game into a virtual farm league for professional football. Oriard then traces the subsequent history of the sport as it has tried to grapple with the fundamental contradiction of college football as both extracurricular activity and multi-billion-dollar mass entertainment. The relentless necessity to pursue revenue, Oriard argues, undermines attempts to maintain academic standards, and it fosters a football culture in which athletes are both excessively entitled and exploited.As a former college football player, Oriard brings a unique perspective to his topic, and his sympathies are always with the players and for the game.

6010,5357,11966,Chicago Tribune Staff,28-Aug-12,"The Chicago Bears' 2011 season was over long before Major Wright's awkward landing on team captain Brian Urlacher's left knee, which ultimately required off-season surgery. Urlacher, writhing in pain on the Metrodome turf during the team's final game, was the final blow to the Bears' 2011 season, which had begun with a promising 7-3 record, ended with the insult of an 8-8 record, and serious injuries to the team's three biggest stars: Brian Urlacher, Jay Cutler, and Matt Forte. 2011's disappointing end marked the fourth time in the previous five seasons that the Bears failed to make the playoffs. While the most direct cause of the Bears' late-season slump was quarterback Jay Cutler's freak thumb injury in Week 11, a lack of depth, adaptability, and success in the draft meant the lion's share of the blame fell on general manager Jerry Angelo. He, along with controversial offensive coordinator Mike Martz, were dismissed at season's end and replaced by long-time scouting director Phil Emery and former offensive line coach Mike Tice, respectively. While Bears onlookers expected a big move during free agency, Emery surprised everyone by making one of his first acquisitions the all-pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Marshall, who played with Cutler for the Denver Broncos, instantly became the most talented receiver ever to grace a Bears roster. The reunion continued when another former Bronco, Jeremy Bates, was brought in to be the quarterbacks coach, completing the triumvirate that helped Cutler and Marshall put up some of their best statistical seasons in Denver. It seemed like the Bears were finally surrounding Cutler with the level of talent he would need to thrive in the pass-happy NFL.Despite added weapons on the offensive end, many questions persisted as the off-season continued. Would Matt Forte's tense contract negotiations be solved before training camp or would a lengthy, damaging holdout follow? Would unheralded first-round pick Shea McClellin help the Bears defensive line issues or would Emery's gamble echo the many draft busts of his predecessor? Would the offensive line protect Cutler enough for him to take advantage of his new weapons? Would Brian Urlacher return at peak form following his gruesome knee injury and mysterious surgery?

When the first jump shooting pioneers left the ground, they rose not only above their defenders, but also above the sports conventions. The jump shot created a soaring offense, infectious excitement, loyal fans, and legends. Basketball would never be the same.Rise and Fire celebrates this crucial shot while tracing the history of how it revolutionized the game, shedding light on all corners of the basketball world, from NBA arenas to the playgrounds of New York City and the barns of Indiana. Award-winning journalist Shawn Fury obsesses over the jump shot, explores its fundamentals, puzzles over its complexities, marvels at its simplicity, and honors those who created some of basketballs greatest moments. Part history, part travelogue, and part memoir, Rise and Fire bounces from the dirt courts of the 1930s to todays NBA courts and state-of-the-art shooting labs, examining everything from how nets and rims affect a shooter to rivalries between shooting coaches to how the three-pointer came to rule the game. Impeccably researched and engaging, the book features interviews and profiles of legendary figures like Jerry West, Bob McAdoo, Ray Allen, and Denise Long---the first woman ever drafted by the NBA, plus dozens more, revealing the evolution of the shot over time.Analyzing the techniques and reliving some of the most unforgettable plays from the greats, Fury creates a technical, personal, historical, and even spiritual examination of the shot. This is not a dry how-to textbook of basketball mechanics; it is a lively tour of basketball history and a love letter to the sport and the shot that changed it forever.

Pitchers are the games lifeblood. Their import is exceeded only by their fragility. One tiny band of tissue in the elbow, the ulnar collateral ligament, is snapping at unprecedented rates, leaving current big league players vulnerable and the coming generation of baseball-playing children dreading the three scariest words in the sport: Tommy John surgery.Jeff Passan traveled the world for three years to explore in-depth the past, present, and future of the arm, and how its evolution left baseball struggling to wrangle its Tommy John surgery epidemic. He examined what compelled the Chicago Cubs to spend $155 million on one arm. He snagged a rare interview with Sandy Koufax, whose career was cut short by injury at thirty, and visited Japan to understand how another baseball-mad country treats its prized arms. And he followed two major league pitchers, Daniel Hudson and Todd Coffey, throughout their returns from Tommy John surgery. He exposes how the baseball establishment long ignored the rise in arm injuries and reveals how misplaced incentives across the sport stifle potential changes.Injuries to the UCL start as early as Little League. Without a drastic cultural shift, baseball will continue to lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually to damaged pitchers, and another generation of children will suffer the same problems that vex current players. Informative and hard-hitting, The Arm is essential reading for everyone who loves the game, wants to keep their children healthy, or relishes a look into how a large, complex institution can fail so spectacularly.

Duke's new man was Mike Krzyzewski. The only problem was, no one knew who Krzyzewski was, he had a so-so record in his short time as head coach of Army, and worst of all, no one could even pronounce his name. The announcement caused head scratches . . . if not immediate calls for his head . . . and on this note his career at Duke began.  The table was set nine days later, when on March 27, 1980, Jim Valvano was hired by North Carolina State to be their new head coach. The hiring didn't raise as many eyebrows, but with the exuberant Valvano on board, two new coaches were now in place to challenge Dean Smithand the most sensational competitive decade in history was about to unfold.  In the skillful hands of John Feinstein, this extraordinary rivalryand the men behind itcome to life in a unique, intimate way. The Legends Club is a sports book that captures an era in American sport and culture, documenting the inside view of a decade of absolutely incredible competition. Feinstein pulls back the curtain on the recruiting wars, the intensely personal competition that wasn't always friendly, the enormous pressure and national stakes, and the battle for the very soul of college basketball allegiance in a hot-bed area. Getting to the roots of the NCAA goliath that is followed religiously by millions of fans today, Feinstein uses his unprecedented access to all three coaches to paint a portrait only he could conjure. The Legends Club is destined to be one of Feinstein's biggest bestsellers.

Now a world-famous theoretical physicist with hundreds of scientific articles and several books of popular science to his credit, he felt it was time to connect with nature in less theoretical ways. After seeing a fly-fishing class on the Dartmouth College green, he decided to learn to fly-fish, a hobby, he says, that teaches humility. In The Simple Beauty of the Unexpected, Gleiser travels the world to scientific conferences, fishing wherever he goes. At each stop, he ponders how in the myriad ways physics informs the act of fishing; how, in its turn, fishing serves as a lens into natures inner workings; and how science engages with questions of meaning and spirituality, inspiring a sense of mystery and awe of the not yet known. Personal and engaging, The Simple Beauty of the Unexpected is a scientists tribute to nature, an affirmation of humanitys deep connection with and debt to Earth, and an exploration of the meaning of existence, from atom to trout to cosmos.

Years ago, however, Brandel Chamblee, the highly regarded Golf Channel analyst and former PGA Tour professional, noticed that the best players of all time have shared similar positions in each part of the swing, from the grip and setup to the footwork, backswing, and follow-through. Since then, Chamblee, a student of games history, has used scientific precision and thoroughness to make a study of the common swing positions of the greats. Now, in The Anatomy of Greatness, he reveals what he has learned, offers hundreds of photographs as his proof, to show us how we can easily incorporate his findings into our own swings to hit the ball farther, straighter, and more consistently. What does it tell us that the majority of the greatsfrom Jack Nicklaus and Byron Nelson to modern masters like Tiger Woodsemploy a strong grip on the club? How did legends like Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Mickey Wright, and Gary Player unlock hidden power and control by turning in the right knee at address? Why are some modern teachers preaching quiet footwork when forty-eight of the top fifty golfers of all time lifted their left heels on the backswing, allowing them to build power? At the same time that Chamblee is extolling certain swing virtues, he also debunks a number of popularbut misguidedswing philosophies that have been hindering golfers for years. The result is perhaps the best and clearest explanation of how to hit a golf ball ever published. The Anatomy of Greatness is a book that golfers can take to the driving range and use Chamblees clear explanations to build better swingsand get more speed and consistency into their swingsimmediately. It is like having a series of private lessons from the best golfers of all time, and it will help golfers build swings that make the game easier and more fun.

For some of themknown as the Scum Bunchtheir debauchery off the field was even more awe-inspiring. But when that golden season ended, so did their aura of invincibility. Some faced battles with addiction, some were traded, and others struggled just to keep their lives together.   Through interviews with these legendary players, Erik Sherman offers fans a new perspective on a team that will forever be remembered in sports history.INCLUDES PHOTOSFrom the Hardcover edition.",0,0,Penguin Publishing Group,Kings of Queens,William Thomas,,"From acclaimed humorist William Thomas comes the funny yet poignant story of a thoroughbred racehorse that lost 100 races in a row -- but, in everyone's eyes, became the ultimate winner.On April 20, 1991, at Capritaur Farms in Upstate New York, Zippy Chippy strolled into the world. He was born from American horse racing royalty -- Compliance (his father was Kentucky Derby-winner Northern Dancer; his great-grandfather Native Dancer, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner) and Listen Lady (great-granddaughter of Native Dancer). Even before his birth, the hopes (not to mention the bill for his planned production) for Zippy Chippy were high. His pedigree was horse racing gold: Northern Dancer, Man o' War, Count Fleet, Bold Ruler, War Admiral, and Buckpasser were all ancestors. His success and glory seemed inevitable. But moments after his birth, Zippy Chippy struggled to his feet, took two steps forward . . . and stopped dead in his tracks. He looked around, took in his surroundings, maybe indulged in a little daydream, then promptly lay down for a nap in the straw. And thus began Zippy Chippy's storied racing career. Vince Lombardi, one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time, famously said, ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing."" These words have become the battle cry of athletes, coaches, and teams everywhere, but over the years, sports have taken on a literal interpretation of Lombardi's mantra. Match-fixing, doping, sabotage, cocky and mean sportsmanship, all in the name of winning, have infiltrated and scandalized games, teams, reputations, and newspaper headlines. Yet, since his first moments in the world, Zippy Chippy ignored Lombardi and turned his nose at the concept of winning-at-all-costs. In fact, he decided to not win at all, losing, over the course of his career, 100 consecutive races, at some of the greatest tracks in the country: Belmont Park, Aqueduct, Finger Lakes, and Suffolk Downs among them. And he did so with his owner, Felix Monserrate, by his side -- a man who refused to sell Zippy, or even retire him, simply because he couldn't come in first. Soon, Zippy's cheering squad grew to include people who, enchanted by his story, would travel from all over North America to watch him lose but then happily gallop back to his stable. To them, Zippy Chippy was just like them; someone who wasn't an athlete with a million-dollar contract, or someone with movie star looks -- he was a creature who struggled, who lost, and who failed even the lowest of expectations. But, somehow, he found a way to enjoy himself and eagerly return for the next race. Told with laugh-out-loud wit and a lot of heart, The Legend of Zippy Chippy is the story of the losing-est racehorse in North American history -- a perpetual loser who would become the winning thoroughbred in professional horse racing to steal peoples' hearts.From the Hardcover edition.

Rieff's brave, passionate, and unsparing witness of the last nine months of her life, from her initial diagnosis to her death, is both an intensely personal portrait of the relationship between a mother and a son, and a reflection on what it is like to try to help someone gravely ill in her fight to go on living and, when the time comes, to die with dignity.   Rieff offers no easy answers. Instead, his intensely personal book is a meditation on what it means to confront death in our culture. In his most profound work, this brilliant writer confronts the blunt feelings of the survivor -- the guilt, the self-questioning, the sense of not having done enough.   And he tries to understand what it means to desire so desperately, as his mother did to the end of her life, to try almost anything in order to go on living.   Drawing on his mother's heroic struggle, paying tribute to her doctors' ingenuity and faithfulness, and determined to tell what happened to them all, Swimming in a Sea of Death subtly draws wider lessons that will be of value to others when they find themselves in the same situation.

In the skillful hands of John Feinstein, this extraordinary rivalryand the men behind itcome to life in a unique, intimate way. The Legends Club is a sports book that captures an era in American sport and culture, documenting the inside view of a decade of absolutely incredible competition. Feinstein pulls back the curtain on the recruiting wars, the intensely personal competition that wasn't always friendly, the enormous pressure and national stakes, and the battle for the very soul of college basketball allegiance in a hot-bed area. Getting to the roots of the NCAA goliath that is followed religiously by millions of fans today, Feinstein uses his unprecedented access to all three coaches to paint a portrait only he could conjure. The Legends Club is destined to be one of Feinstein's biggest bestsellers.

Yet Sexton argues that one is actually a pathway to the other.Baseball as a Road to God is about touching that something that lies beyond logical understanding. Sexton illuminates the surprisingly large number of mutual concepts shared between baseball and religion: faith, doubt, conversion, miracles, and even sacredness among many others.Structured like a game and filled with riveting accounts of baseballs most historic moments, Baseball as Road to God will enthrall baseball fans whatever their religious beliefs may be.

7266,6426,8682,Michael J. Schell,3-Dec-13,"Tony Gwynn is the greatest hitter in the history of baseball. That's the conclusion of this engaging and provocative analysis of baseball's all-time best hitters. Michael Schell challenges the traditional list of all-time hitters, which places Ty Cobb first, Gwynn 16th, and includes just 8 players whose prime came after 1960. Schell argues that the raw batting averages used as the list's basis should be adjusted to take into account that hitters played in different eras, with different rules, and in different ballparks. He makes those adjustments and produces a new list of the best 100 hitters that will spark debate among baseball fans and statisticians everywhere.Schell combines the two qualifications essential for a book like this. He is a professional statistician--applying his skills to cancer research--and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of baseball. He has wondered how to rank hitters since he was a boy growing up as a passionate Cincinnati Reds fan. Over the years, he has analyzed the most important factors, including the relative difficulty of hitting in different ballparks, the length of hitters' careers, the talent pool that players are drawn from, and changes in the game that raised or lowered major-league batting averages (the introduction of the designated hitter and changes in the height and location of the pitcher's mound, for example). Schell's study finally levels the playing field, giving new credit to hitters who played in adverse conditions and downgrading others who faced fewer obstacles. His final ranking of players differs dramatically from the traditional list. Gwynn, for example, bumps Cobb to 2nd place, Rod Carew rises from 28th to 3rd, Babe Ruth drops from 9th to 16th, and Willie Mays comes from off the list to rank 13th. Schell's list also gives relatively more credit to modern players, containing 39 whose best days were after 1960.Using a fun, conversational style, the book presents a feast of stories and statistics about players, ballparks, and teams--all arranged so that calculations can be skipped by general readers but consulted by statisticians eager to follow Schell's methods or introduce their students to such basic concepts as mean, histogram, standard deviation, p-value, and regression.
