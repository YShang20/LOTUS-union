Author Steve Clarke has collected every essential piece of Blue Jays knowledge and trivia, as well as must-do activities, and ranks them all, providing an entertaining and easy-to-follow checklist as readers progress on their way to fan superstardom. Most Blue Jays fans have taken in a game or two at Rogers Centre, have seen highlights of a young Dave Stieb, and remember where they were when Joe Carter hit his World Serieswinning home run in 1993. But only real fans know who spent two decades as the teams BJ Birdy mascot, can name the opposing player who was once jailed for hitting a seagull with a thrown baseball at Exhibition Stadium, or how long it takes to open the Rogers Centre roof. 100 Things Blue Jays Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die stands as the ultimate resource for true fans of Canadas sole major league baseball team.",272,11.99,Triumph Books,100 Things Blue Jays Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die,table1
66,Mike Roberts & Brian Roberts,1-Dec-08,"""You Can't Steal Second Base and Keep Your Foot on First"" is the title of my book (written with my son Brian, 2nd Baseman for the Baltimore Orioles) and we also have a new teaching DVD about Base Stealing which shows many of the techniques developed by Brian during his career. Brian was small and a very average amateur player until he was 19 years old. Base stealing kept him enjoying baseball, gave him some confidence, and helped him help his team until he became stronger and improved his other skills.
Brian grew up playing in the backyard with his parents and friends. He played the game of Pickle most days, which helped his base stealing instincts. ""Backyard Baseball is a Passionate, Instinctive, Fun Game"" and I post these words in the home dugout of the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape Cod League.
Base Stealing will bring consistency to a baseball offense regardless of team speed. I have 25 new players in Cotuit, Ma. each summer. We begin base stealing practice the first day and work on this aspect of the game almost every day. The Kettleers have won the Cape Cod League Championship 2 of the past 4 seasons including August 2013. Base stealing is the key element that brings that consistency and keeps constant pressure on the opposing team.
Definition of Base Stealing: A runner(s) trying to take advantage of the defensive team thru good technique and speed going in a straight line to advance a base as the ball is thrown from the pitcher to the catcher.
Confidence: The base stealer(s) must feel they have control of the game even though the pitcher is initially in control of the baseball.
Comfort: The base stealer must be as comfortable when off the base preparing to steal as they are when just standing on the base.",0,14.99,MRob Publishing,You Can't Steal Second Base and Keep Your Foot on First!,table1

3496,Doug Scott,,"At dusk on 24 September 1975, Doug Scott and Dougal Haston became the first Britons to reach the summit of Everest as lead climbers on Chris Bonington's epic expedition to the mountain's immense south-west face. As darkness fell, Scott and Haston scraped a small cave in the snow 100 metres below the summit and survived the highest bivouac ever - without bottled oxygen, sleeping bags and, as it turned out, frostbite. For Doug Scott, it was the fulfilment of a fortune-teller's prophecy given to his mother: that her eldest son would be in danger in a high place with the whole world watching. Scott and Haston returned home national heroes with their image splashed across the front pages. Scott went on to become one of Britain's greatest ever mountaineers, pioneering new climbs in the remotest corners of the globe. His career spans the golden age of British climbing from the 1960s boom in outdoor adventure to the new wave of lightweight alpinism throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In Up and About, the first volume of his autobiography, Scott tells his story from his birth in Nottingham during the darkest days of war to the summit of the world. Surviving the unplanned bivouac without oxygen near the summit of Everest widened the range of what and how he would climb in the future. In fact, Scott established more climbs on the high mountains of the world after his ascent of Everest than before. Those climbs will be covered in the second volume of his life and times.
